This is a quickstart guide for deploying TigerGraph single servers and clusters in Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS).
  * [Single-server deployment](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_single_server_deployment)
  * [Cluster-deployment](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_cluster_deployment)


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_before_you_begin)1. Before you begin
  * Provision Kubernetes cluster on AKS with nodes that meet the [hardware and software requirements](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/installation/hw-and-sw-requirements) to run TigerGraph.
  * [Install `kubectl` on your machine,](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and make sure your local `kubectl` version is within one minor version’s difference from the `kubectl` version on your cluster.
  * [Configure `kubectl` for AKS cluster access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#connect-to-the-cluster).
  * Ensure your have the following permissions in your Kubernetes context:
    * Create and delete Pods, Services, StatefulSets, and ConfigMaps
    * Create and delete Jobs, CronJobs
    * Create and delete Service Accounts, roles and role bindings


Each of the commands below uses `kubectl` with the default namespace `default`. If you’ve deployed your cluster using a different namespace, you need to explicitly provide the namespace where your cluster is deployed with the `--namespace` option.

Clone the [TigerGraph ecosystems repository](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys) and change into the `k8s` directory. You can edit the `kustimization.yaml` file in the `aks` folder to change the namespace and image name for your deployment. The default namespace is `default`.
Next, run the `./tg` script in the `k8s` directory to generate the deployment manifest for a single-server deployment. You can use the `--prefix` option to specify a prefix for your pods. The default prefix is `tigergraph`.
The script creates a `deploy` directory automatically, and you can find the manifest named `tigergraph-aks-default.yaml` in the directory.
```
$ ./tg aks kustomize -s 1 -v <version> **(1)**
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | `-s <number>` specifies the number of nodes in your cluster. For single-server deployment, the number specified is 1. `-v <version>` specifies the version of TigerGraph you want to provision in your TigerGraph cluster.  
---|---  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_deploy_manifest)2.1.2. Deploy manifest
Run `kubectl apply` to create the deployment using the manifest you generated in the previous step.
```
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/<namespace>-aks/tigergraph-aks-default.yaml
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_verify_single_server)2.2. Verify single server
Run `kubectl get pods` to confirm that the pods were created successfully:
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME       READY  STATUS  RESTARTS  AGE
installer-zsnb4  1/1   Running  0     4m11s
tigergraph-0   1/1   Running  0     4m10s
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Run `kubectl get services` to find the IP addresses of the RESTPP service as well as the GUI service. You can then make curl calls to the IP address of `tg-rest-service` at port 9000 to make sure that RESTPP is running:
```
$ curl <restpp_ip>:9000/echo | jq .
 % Total  % Received % Xferd Average Speed  Time  Time   Time Current
                 Dload Upload  Total  Spent  Left Speed
100  39 100  39  0   0  120   0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  120
{
 "error": false,
 "message": "Hello GSQL"
}
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You can also copy the IP address of the GUI service into your browser and visit port 14240 to make sure that GraphStudio is working.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_connect_to_single_server)2.3. Connect to single server
Use `kubectl` to get a shell to the container or log in via `ssh`:
```
# Via kubectl
kubectl exec -it tigergraph-0 -- /bin/bash
# Via ssh
ip_m1=$(kubectl get pod -o wide |grep tigergraph-0| awk '{print $6}')
ssh tigergraph@ip_m1

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_remove_single_server_resources)2.4. Remove single server resources
Use the `tg` script in the `k8s` directory of the repo to delete all cluster resources. Replace `<namespace_name>` with the name of the namespace within which you want to delete the resources. If you don’t specify a namespace, the command deletes the resources in the namespace `default`:
```
$ ./tg aks delete -n <namespace_name>
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_cluster_deployment)3. Cluster deployment
Once your Kubernetes cluster is ready on AKS, you may deploy a TigerGraph cluster to your AKS Kubernetes cluster.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_deploy_tigergraph_cluster)3.1. Deploy TigerGraph cluster
Take the following steps to deploy a cluster of TigerGraph on AKS:
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_generate_kubernetes_manifest)3.1.1. Generate Kubernetes manifest
Clone the [TigerGraph ecosystem repository](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys.git) and change into the `k8s` directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys.git
$ cd ecosys/k8s
text![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You can customize your deployment by editing the `kustomize.yaml` file in the `aks` directory. The `tg` script in the `k8s` folder offers a convenient way to make common customizations such as namespace, TigerGraph version, as well as cluster size. Run `./tg -h` to view the help text on how to use the script.
Use the `tg` script in the `k8s` directory of the repo to create a Kubernetes manifest. Use `-s` or `--size` to indicate the number of nodes in the cluster. Use the `--ha` option to indicate the replication factor of the cluster, and the partitioning factor is the number of nodes divided by the replication factor.
For example, the following command creates a manifest that will deploy a 3*2 cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 3.
```
$ ./tg aks kustomize -s 6 --ha 2
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

The command creates a directory named `deploy` with the manifest inside.
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_deploy_the_cluster)3.1.2. Deploy the cluster
Run `kubectl apply` to create the deployment
```
$ kubectl apply -f ./deploy/<namespace>-aks/tigergraph-aks-default.yaml
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_verify_cluster)3.2. Verify cluster
Run `kubectl get pods` to verify the pods were created successfully:
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME       READY  STATUS  RESTARTS  AGE
installer-zsnb4  1/1   Running  0     4m11s
tigergraph-0   1/1   Running  0     4m10s
tigergraph-1   1/1   Running  0     75s

```

Run `kubectl get services` to find the IP addresses of the RESTPP service as well as the GUI service. You can then make curl calls to the IP address of `tg-rest-service` at port 9000 to make sure that RESTPP is running:
```
$ curl <restpp_ip>:9000/echo | jq .
 % Total  % Received % Xferd Average Speed  Time  Time   Time Current
                 Dload Upload  Total  Spent  Left Speed

{
 "error": false,
 "message": "Hello GSQL"
}
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You can also copy the IP address of the GUI service into your browser and visit port 14240 to make sure that GraphStudio is working.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks#_connect_to_instances)3.3. Connect to instances
You can use `kubectl` to get a shell to the container or log in via `ssh`
```
# Via kubectl
kubectl exec -it tigergraph-0 -- /bin/bash

# Via ssh
ip_m1=$(kubectl get pod -o wide |grep tigergraph-0| awk '{print $6}')
ssh tigergraph@ip_m1
