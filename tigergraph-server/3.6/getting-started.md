# Getting Started
Welcome to the TigerGraph™ Platform - the first real-time, Native Parallel Graph data analytics platform. This document covers the various options to get started with TigerGraph.
  * If you are a Mac or Windows user, we recommend you use Docker to start up TigerGraph on your computer: [Get Started with Docker](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/getting-started/docker).
  * If you have a Linux machine that meets our [Hardware and Software Requirements](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/installation/hw-and-sw-requirements), you can install TigerGraph on your machine directly: [Installation Guide](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/installation/install).
  * If you would like to run TigerGraph on a Virtual Machine with Virtual Box, follow this guide: [Get Started with Virtual Box](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/getting-started/virtual-box).
  * You can also start up TigerGraph instances from Cloud Images on AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform: [Get Started from Cloud Images](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/getting-started/cloud-images/)
