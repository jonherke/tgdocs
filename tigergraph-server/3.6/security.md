Not available in TigerGraph 3.6 LTS. Available in TigerGraph 3.9+   
---  
TigerGraph users can upload [user-defined function (UDF) files](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/querying/func/query-user-defined-functions) to the server and run them as part of a query or loading job. In order to prevent security issues with code execution, TigerGraph Server disables this ability by default and requires it to be enabled manually by an administrator.
In addition, the UDF files are scanned to make sure they comply with the file policy. The scanning process, by default, consists of three parts.
The file scanning policy is controlled by a `gadmin` parameter, `GSQL.UDF.Policy.Enable`, which defaults to `true`. For more information, see the [Configuration Parameters](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/reference/configuration-parameters) page.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/security/#_disabled_macros_with_replacement)Disabled macros with replacement
Macros with replacement are not allowed, for example `#define TABLE_SIZE 100`. However, macros without replacement can still be used, such as `#define EXPRFUNCTIONS_HPP`.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/security/#_file_header_allowlist)File header allowlist
Only the headers present in the allowlist can be included in UDF files. UDF files with different headers will not be accepted. The list is case-sensitive.
```
[
"stdlib.h", "string", "tuple",
"vector", "list", "deque", "arrays", "forward_list",
"queue", "priority_queue", "stack",
"set", "multiset", "map", "multimap",
"unordered_set", "unordered_multiset", "unordered_map", "unordered_multimap",
"iterator",
"sstream",
"algorithm", "math.h"
]

```

This is customizable with the `gadmin` command `GSQL.UDF.Policy.HeaderAllowlist`. `ExprUtil.hpp` and `tg_ExprUtil.hpp` are always allowed, and do not need to be declared in the allowlist.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/security/#_blocklist)Blocklist
TigerGraph also has a non-modifiable blocklist that prevents certain C++ features from being used. For security reasons, this list is not publicly available. Contact support@tigergraph.com for more details about the blocklist policy.
