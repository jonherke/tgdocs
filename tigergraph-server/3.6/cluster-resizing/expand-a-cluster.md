Expanding a cluster adds more nodes to the cluster. During the expansion, the cluster’s data is redistributed across the expanded cluster. You can also change replication factor during an expansion.
Expanding a cluster may make sense for several reasons:
  * to improve query performance
  * to improve system availability
  * to improve fault tolerance


Cluster expansion requires several minutes of cluster downtime. The exact amount of downtime varies depending on the size of your cluster.
If your TigerGraph cluster uses a seeded license, please contact TigerGraph support to obtain an unseeded temporary license before expanding your cluster.   
---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/cluster-resizing/expand-a-cluster#_before_you_begin)1. Before you begin
You must adhere to all of the following requirements.  
---  
  * The new nodes must already have **exactly the same version** of TigerGraph software installed as the nodes you are expanding from.
  * The new nodes must not have any data you wish to keep.
  * Ensure that the cluster is not using shared storage. Cluster expansion does not support shared storage.
  * Ensure that no loading jobs, queries, or REST requests are running on the original or the expansion target.
  * If the original cluster is a single node installation, make sure the IP used is not a [local loopback address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost) such as 127.0.0.1.


You can check the IP address of your original cluster using `gadmin config get System.HostList`. If it is a loopback IP, you can update it to be the internal IP using the following script: ```
$ gadmin config set System.HostList '[{"Hostname":"'$(ip a | grep "inet " | awk 'FNR == 2 {print $2}' | awk -F "/" '{print $1}')'","ID":"m1","Region":""}]'
$ gadmin config apply -y
$ gadmin restart all -y![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!
```
  
---  
Advice and Precautions
  * Obtain a few key measures for the state of your data before the expansion, such as vertex counts/edge counts or certain query results. This will be useful in verifying data integrity after the expansion completes.
  * Perform a full backup of your existing system before performing the expansion.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/cluster-resizing/expand-a-cluster#_procedure)2. Procedure
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/cluster-resizing/expand-a-cluster#_identify_new_cluster_replication_and_partition)2.1. Identify new cluster replication and partition
Before running any commands to expand a cluster, make sure you have a clear idea of how the new cluster should be distributed. You should have the following information:
  * The new replication factor of the cluster
  * The new partitioning factor of the cluster
  * The IP addresses of the new nodes to be added to the cluster


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/cluster-resizing/expand-a-cluster#_expand_the_cluster)2.2. Expand the cluster
To expand the cluster, run the `gadmin cluster expand` command as shown. If the expansion involves changing the replication factor, use the `--ha` option to indicate the new replication factor:
```
$ gadmin cluster expand node_ip_list [--ha <replication_factor>]
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

`node_ip_list` is the machine aliases of the nodes you are adding to the cluster mapped to their IP addresses with a colon(`:`), and separated by a comma. Below is an example:
```
$ gadmin cluster expand m3:10.128.0.81,m4:10.128.0.82 --ha 1
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

We suggest naming the new nodes following the convention of `m<count>`, such as `m1`, `m2`, and `m3` for a 3-node cluster. If you are adding a fourth node, then the fourth node would be named `m4`. If you decide to name them differently, make sure that all names are unique within the cluster.
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/cluster-resizing/expand-a-cluster#_supply_a_staging_location)2.2.1. Supply a staging location
Extra disk space is required during cluster expansion. If more space is not available on the same disk, you can supply a staging location on a different disk to hold temporary data:
```
$ gadmin cluster expand m3:192.168.1.3,m4:192.168.1.4 --stagingPath /tmp/
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

If you choose to supply a staging location, make sure that the TigerGraph Linux user has write permission to the path you provide. The overall amount of space required for expansion on each node is `(1 + ceiling(oldPartition/newPartition) ) * dataRootSize`. `oldPartition` and `newPartition` stand for the partitioning factors of the cluster before and after expansion, respectively; `dataRootSize` stands for the size of the data root folder on the node.
For example, assume you are expanding from a 6-node cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 3, to a 10-node cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 5, and the size of the data root folder on a node is 50GB. You would need more than `(1 + ceiling(3/5)) * 50) = 100 GB` of free space on the staging path.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/cluster-resizing/expand-a-cluster#_verify_success_and_delete_temporary_files)2.3. Verify success and delete temporary files
When the expansion completes, you should see a message confirming the completion of the cluster change. The message will also include the location of the temporary files created during the expansion.
Verify data integrity by comparing vertex/edge counts or query results. After confirming a successful expansion, delete the temporary files to free up disk space.
