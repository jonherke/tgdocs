  * Fixed `/deleted_vertex_check` false alert when GSE doesn’t have a segment and there are no active vertices on the GPE. (CORE-2823)


#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_backup)Backup
  * Fix an error in the application server that was conflating the schedule for local backup with cloud backup. (TP-3436)

#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_in_replicated_clusters)In Replicated Clusters
  * Fixed an issue in which lastSeqId could get out of sync across a CRR multicluster system when a query installation was triggered by a schema change. (GLE-5403)
  * Fixed an issue in which a user registered on the primary cluster of a CRR system was not able to run a query on the secondary cluster, because the secondary cluster was inappropriately creating a new secret for the user. (GLE-5419)
  * Fixed an issue in which the Kafka offset of a GSQL server in a secondary cluster could become lost if the secondary cluster is shut down while active. (GLE-5411)
  * Fixed an issue in which deleting or refreshing an authentication token could cause cross-region replication to become out of sync.(GLE-5433)
  * Refined the self-protection tests that trigger an intentional GSE crash/panic so that receiving duplicate messages only triggers a crash if the receiver is the primary cluster in a replicated system.(CORE-2610)
  * Fixed an issue in which the GSE Kafka Syncer could get stuck if a secondary replica is promoted to be the primary replica (PR), and if the old PR’s term ID was larger than the new PR’s term ID. (CORE-2602)
  * Fixed a rare GSE crash caused by the lease thread not selecting a new GSE leader when the current GSE leader takes too long to respond to a heartbeat check due to high CPU load. Also added log messages to make diagnosis easily. (CORE-2871)
  * Fixed a null pointer exception in the TokenCleaner routine which is called when a follower transitions to leader. (GLE-5203)

  * Fixed a null pointer exception when importing a GraphStudio solution package. (GLE-5612)


#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_3_6_4_mitigations)Mitigations
  * If a secondary replica (SR) is performing work on many vertices so that several messages are required, and if it sees a gap in the vertex IDs from one message to the message, the SR’s GSE will intentionally crash, to prevent entering a possibly inconsistent state. (CORE-2503)
  * If data is being loaded to a replicated system, and the process notices an inconsistency in the number of edges reporting on one replica vs. another, then the GPE will intentionally crash to prevent additional errors. (CORE-2646)

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_deprecation_and_compatibility_warnings)Deprecation and Compatibility Warnings
  * The `-OPTIMIZE` flag for `INSTALL QUERY` is deprecated and is planned to be dropped in the 3.7 release.
  * Begining with 3.6.3, a vertex having an empty string as its primary id cannot be loaded. Previously, such a vertex was permitted.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_known_issues)Known Issues
  * When available memory becomes very low in a cluster and there are a large number of vertex deletions to process, some remote servers might have difficulty receiving the metadata needed to be aware of all the deletions across the full cluster. The mismatched metadata will cause the GPE to go down.
  * If `System.Backup.Local.Enable` is set to `true`, this also enables a daily full backup at 12:00am UTC
  * Vertex primary IDs are treated as STRING, regardless of whether they are declared as STRING, INT, or UINT. If a vertex is defined to have INT or UINT type IDs, but the user tries to load string values, the string values will be accepted, because the type is not checked. If the `primary_id_as_attribute` option is selected, then attending to perform numeric options on a pirmary id may encounter a data type conflict error.

  * A single `POST-ACCUM` clause can no longer reference more than one vertex alias in Syntax V1.
  * `GET /requesttoken` endpoint is dropped. Please use `POST /requesttoken` to request authentication tokens instead.
    * Using request body to store credentials is more secure than using query string. If you have a create a token request that puts the credentials in the query string, all you need to do is use the `POST` endpoint and move your credentials to the request body.
  * `GET /gsqlserver/gsql/queryinfo` endpoint on port 14240 now returns the query input parameters in the same order as they are in the query instead of an unordered list.
  * Deploying TigerGraph in Kubernetes now requires more service account permissions than previous versions. For details, see Prerequisites section in [Quickstart with GKE](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-gke), [Quickstart with AKS](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-aks), and [Quickstart with EKS](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/kubernetes/quickstart-with-eks).


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_compatibility_with_tigergraph_3_1)Compatibility with TigerGraph 3.1
The following changes were made to the built-in roles in TigerGraph’s Role-based Access Control
  * The built-in role `queryreader` can no longer run queries that include updates to the database.
    * To emulate the old `queryreader` role, create a role with all `queryreader` privileges, and also grant the `WRITE_DATA` privilege to the new role.
  * The built-in role `admin` can no longer create users
    * To emulate the old `admin` role, create a global role with all `admin` privileges, and also grant the `WRITE_USER` privilege to the new role.
  * To learn more about role management and the privileges of built-in roles, see:

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_compatibility_with_tigergraph_2)Compatibility with TigerGraph 2
Major revisions (e.g., from TigerGraph 2 to TigerGraph 3) are the opportunity to deliver significant improvements. While we make every effort to maintain backward compatibility, in selected cases APIs have changed or deprecated features have been dropped, in order to advance the overall product.
**Data migration** : A tool is available to migrate the data in TigerGraph 2.6 to TigerGraph 3.0. Please contact TigerGraph Support for assistance.
**Query and API compatibility** :
  * Some gadmin syntax has changed. Notably. `gadmin set config` is now `gadmin config set`. Please see [Managing with gadmin](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/system-management/management-with-gadmin).
  * Some features which were previously deprecated have been dropped. Please see [V3.0 Removal of Previously Deprecated Features](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features) for a detailed list.

TigerGraph 2.x contained some features which were labeled as deprecated. These features are no longer necessary because they have been superseded already by improved approaches for using the TigerGraph platform.
The new approaches were developed because they use more consistent grammar, are more extensible, or offer higher performance. Therefore, TigerGraph 3.0 and above has streamlined the product by removing support for some of these deprecated features, listed below:
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/#_data_types)Data Types

`STRING_LIST_CONPRESS` | Use `LIST<STRING COMPRESS>`  
`UINT_SET` | Use `SET<INT>`  
`UINT32_UINT32_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<UINT, UINT>`  
`INT32_INT32_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<INT, INT>`  
`UINT32_UDT_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<UINT, UDT_type>`, where `UDT_type` is a user-defined tuple type  
`INT32_UDT_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<INT, UDT_type>`, where `UDT_type` is a user-defined tuple type
