### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_v3_0_removal_of_previously_deprecated_features)V3.0 Removal of Previously Deprecated Features
TigerGraph 2.x contained some features which were labeled as deprecated. These features are no longer necessary because they have been superseded already by improved approaches for using the TigerGraph platform.
The new approaches were developed because they use more consistent grammar, are more extensible, or offer higher performance. Therefore, TigerGraph 3.0 and above has streamlined the product by removing support for some of these deprecated features, listed below:
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_data_types)Data Types
Deprecated type | Alternate approach  
---|---  
`REAL` | Use `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE`  
`INT_SET` | Use `SET<INT>`  
`INT_LIST` | Use `LIST<INT>`  
`STRING_SET_COMPRESS` | Use `SET<STRING COMPRESS>`  
`STRING_LIST_CONPRESS` | Use `LIST<STRING COMPRESS>`  
`UINT_SET` | Use `SET<INT>`  
`UINT32_UINT32_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<UINT, UINT>`  
`INT32_INT32_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<INT, INT>`  
`UINT32_UDT_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<UINT, UDT_type>`, where `UDT_type` is a user-defined tuple type  
`INT32_UDT_KV_LIST` | Use `MAP<INT, UDT_type>`, where `UDT_type` is a user-defined tuple type  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_syntax_for_control_flow_statements)Syntax for Control Flow Statements
Deprecated statement | Alternate statement  
---|---  
`FOREACH …​ DO …​ DONE` | `FOREACH…​ DO…​ END`  
```
FOREACH (condition) {
  body
}
```
|  ```
FOREACH condition DO
  body
END
```
  
```
IF (condition) {
  body1
}
else {
  body2
}
```
|  ```
IF condition THEN
  body1
ELSE
  body2
END
```
  
```
WHILE (condition) {
  body
}
```
|  ```
WHILE condition DO
  body
END
```
  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_vertex_set_variable_declaration)Vertex set variable declaration
See [Vertex Set Variable Declaration and Assignment](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/3.6/querying/declaration-and-assignment-statements#_vertex_set_variables)
If a vertex type is specified, the vertex type must be within parentheses.
Deprecated Statement | Alternate Statement  
---|---  
`MySet Person = …​` | `MySet (Person) = …​`  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_query_job_and_token_management)Query, Job, and Token Management
Deprecated operation | Header 2  
---|---  
`CREATE JOB` |  Job types need to be specified:
  * `CREATE LOADING JOB`
  * `CREATE SCHEMA_CHANGE JOB`
  * `CREATE GLOBAL SCHEMA_CHANGE JOB`

  
`RUN JOB` |  Job types need to be specified:
  * `RUN LOADING JOB`
  * `RUN SCHEMA_CHANGE JOB`
  * `RUN GLOBAL SCHEMA_CHANGE JOB`

  
`CREATE / SHOW/ REFRESH TOKEN` | To create a token, use the [REST endpoint GET /requesttoken](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/API/built-in-endpoints#_request_a_token).  
`offline2online` | The offline loading job mode was discontinued in v2.0. Do not write loading jobs using this syntax.  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_output)Output
See [PRINT Statement](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/3.6/querying/output-statements-and-file-objects#_print_statement_api_v2)
Deprecated Syntax | Alternate Syntax  
---|---  
JSON API v1 | v2 has been the default JSON format since TigerGraph 1.1. No alternate JSON version will be available.  
`PRINT …​ TO_CSV [filepath]` | Define a file object, then `PRINT …​ TO_CSV [file_object]`  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/release-notes/v3.0-removal-of-previously-deprecated-features#_built_in_queries)Built-in Queries
Deprecated statement | Alternate statement  
---|---  
`SELECT count() FROM …​` | 
  * `SELECT approx_count(*) FROM …​`
    * May not include all the latest data updates
  * `SELECT count(*) FROM …​`
    * exact, but slower than `approx_count(*)`
