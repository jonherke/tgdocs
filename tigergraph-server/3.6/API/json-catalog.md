# Built-in Endpoints JSON Catalog
The request
```
curl -X GET "http://server_ip:9000/endpoints?builtin=true"
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

generates the following output, appropriately 400 lines long when formatted. In addition to listing each endpoint, the JSON output also lists all the required and optional parameters for each endpoint. In turn, each parameter is described by some or all of these attributes:
  * default
  * max_count
  * min_count
  * type
  * max_length
  * is_id
  * id_type


While this information alone is not sufficient for a full understanding of each endpoint, the descriptive names of parameters and the attribute values go a long way towards this goal.
