TigerGraph, the world’s fastest and most scalable graph analytics platform, breaks through the limitations of other graph technologies to enable real-time big data graph applications. It also lowers cost by getting more done with less storage, less memory, and less time.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_gsql)GSQL
The GSQL™ software program is the TigerGraph comprehensive environment for designing graph schemas, loading and managing data to build a graph, and querying the graph to perform data analysis. In short, TigerGraph users do most of their work via the GSQL program.
To learn more about GSQL, see the [GSQL Language Reference](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/intro/).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_tigergraph_data_science_library)TigerGraph Data Science Library
TigerGraph provides a collection of expertly written GSQL queries that efficiently implement common graph algorithms. For more information, see [TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/intro/).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_graphstudio_and_admin_portal)GraphStudio and Admin Portal
GraphStudio and Admin Portal are TigerGraph’s Graphic User Interfaces.
The TigerGraph GraphStudio™ UI (User Interface) provides an intuitive, browser-based interface that helps users get started quickly with graph-based application development tasks: designing a graph schema, creating a schema mapping, loading data, exploring the graph, and writing GSQL queries.
The TigerGraph Admin Portal is a browser-based devops tool which provides users an overview of a running TigerGraph system, from an application and infrastructure point of view. It also allows the users to configure the TigerGraph system through a user-friendly interface.
To learn more about GraphStudio and Admin Portal, see [GraphStudio and Admin Portal](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/graphstudio/overview).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_tigergraph_cloud)TigerGraph Cloud
TigerGraph Cloud is a fully-managed cloud database built on the same TigerGraph Enterprise Server engine that is delivering the fastest and most scalable graph database. TigerGraph Cloud handles all the complexity of deploying and managing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS, Azure, and GCP).
For more information, see [TigerGraph Cloud Classic](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/start/overview).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_versioning)Versioning
TigerGraph uses [sequence-based identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning). Versions are numbered in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
  * `MAJOR` version releases indicate the most significant full releases.
  * `MINOR` version releases indicate less significant releases.
  * `PATCH` version releases indicate backward compatible bug fixes.


We create a new branch of documentation for every major and minor release. To view the documentation of a particular TigerGraph version, use either of the version selectors in the upper right or lower left corners of the page.
For a more detailed description of the TigerGraph release process, please see the [Release and Patch Process](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/release-process) section of the documentation.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_architecture_overview)Architecture overview
The TigerGraph Platform runs on standard, commodity-grade Linux servers. The core components of the Graph Storage Engine (GSE) and the Graph Processing Engine (GPE) are implemented in C++ for optimal performance. TigerGraph is designed to fit into your existing environment with a minimum of fuss.
  * Data Sources: The platform includes a flexible, high-performance data loader which can stream in tabular or semi-structured data, while the system is online.
  * Infrastructure : The platform is available for on-premises, cloud, or hybrid use.
  * Integration : REST APIs are provided to integrate your TigerGraph with your existing enterprise data infrastructure and workflow.


The TigerGraph system uses a message-passing design to coordinate the activities of the components. RESTPP, an enhanced RESTful server, is central to the task management. Users can choose how they wish to interact with the system:
  * **GSQL client** : One TigerGraph instance can support multiple GSQL clients, on remote nodes.
  * **GraphStudio** : Our intuitive graphical user interface, which provides most of the basic GSQL functionality.
  * **REST API** : Enterprise applications which need to run the same queries many times can maximize their efficiency by communicating directly with RESTPP.
  * **gAdmin** is used for system administration.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.6/intro/#_high_performance)High performance
TigerGraph provides high-performance data ingestion and querying. In particular:
  * Fast data loading speed to build graphs - able to load 50 to 150 GB of data per hour, per machine.
  * Fast execution of parallel graph algorithms - able to traverse hundreds of million of vertices/edges per second, per machine.
  * Real-time updates and inserts using REST - able to stream 2B+ daily events in real-time to a graph with 100B+ vertices and 600B+ edges on a cluster of only 20 commodity machines.
  * Ability to unify real-time analytics with large scale offline data processing - the first and only such system.
