Region awareness represents a more sophisticated High Availability (HA) configuration within TigerGraph servers. In contrast to standard [High Availability](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/ha-overview) clusters, region-aware clusters offer HA at the **region/zone level** rather than the **individual node level**.
Enabling region awareness involves deploying TigerGraph services based on distinct regions/zones. For instance, consider a 10-node cluster with 2 replicas spanning 3 regions/zones:
Host ID | Hostname | Region  
---|---|---  
m1 | 192.168.0.1 | us-east-1  
m2 | 192.168.0.2 | us-east-1  
m3 | 192.168.0.3 | us-east-2  
m4 | 192.168.0.4 | us-east-2  
m5 | 192.168.0.5 | us-east-2  
m6 | 192.168.0.6 | us-east-1  
m7 | 192.168.0.7 | us-east-1  
m8 | 192.168.0.8 | us-east-3  
m9 | 192.168.0.9 | us-east-3  
m10 | 192.168.0.10 | us-east-3  
Without region awareness enabled, the service deployments would be as follows:
Table 1. Example, Service deployments without region-aware Service | Nodes  
---|---  
CTRL | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3]  
GSQL | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3,m4,m5]  
ZK | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3,m4,m5]  
ETCD | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3,m4,m5]  
GPE_1 | us-east-1:[m1,m6]  
GPE_2 | us-east-1:[m2,m7]  
GPE_3 | us-east-2:[m3], us-east-3:[m8]  
GPE_4 | us-east-2:[m4], us-east-3:[m9]  
GPE_5 | us-east-2:[m5], us-east-3:[m10]  
In this scenario, a failure in the region `us-east-1` would result in GPE_1, and GPE_2 losing all replicas, while a failure in `us-east-2` would cause ZK and ETCD to lose the majority of replicas.
ZK and ETCD require at least more than half of the nodes to provide services  
---  
By enabling region awareness, the service deployments would be structured as follows:
Table 2. Example, Service deployments with region-aware Service | Nodes  
---|---  
CTRL | us-east-1:[m1], us-east-2:[m3], us-east-3:[m8]  
GSQL | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3,m4], us-east-3:[m8]  
ZK | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3,m4], us-east-3:[m8]  
ETCD | us-east-1:[m1,m2], us-east-2:[m3,m4], us-east-3:[m8]  
GPE_1 | us-east-1:[m1], us-east-2:[m3]  
GPE_2 | us-east-3:[m8], us-east-1:[m2]  
GPE_3 | us-east-2:[m4], us-east-3:[m9]  
GPE_4 | us-east-1:[m6], us-east-2:[m5]  
GPE_5 | us-east-3:[m10], us-east-1:[m7]  
In this setup, a failure in any region/zone would retain at least one replica of GPE for each partition and the majority count of ZK/ETCD replicas.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/region-aware#_compare_to_crr)Compare to CRR
Region-Awareness **is not** [Cross-Region Replication](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/crr-index).
Both Region-Aware and CRR can increase your system availability, but they are designed for different purpose.
Table 3. Differences between Region-Aware and CRR **Region-Aware** | **CRR**  
---|---  
Cluster Setup | 1 read-write cluster | 1 read-write cluster, other read-only cluster  
Minimum nodes | 3 | 2  
Fail over | Auto recover | Manual switch  
Query latency | Higher | Lower  
Enabling region-awareness enhances the deployment of cluster nodes across different regions, potentially resulting in increased query latency.  
---  
For seamless region failure tolerance without downtime, opt for region-awareness. For compliance with data residency regulations and Blue/Green deployments, consider utilizing CRR.
This is not an either/or situation, you can enable region-awareness and CRR at the same time.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/region-aware#_system_requirements)System Requirements
To enable region-aware, the following conditions must be met  
---  
  * Eligible for [High Availability Cluster](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/ha-cluster#_system_requirements)
  * All nodes contain region information
  * At least 3 regions/zones
  * Nodes are uniformly distributed in the region/zone. That is, the difference in the number of nodes in all regions/zones does not exceed 1


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/region-aware#_enable_region_aware)Enable Region Aware
There are two ways to enable region-aware cluster:
  * Configure HA settings [during installation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/installation/bare-metal-install#_step_2_configure_installation_settings).
  * [Expand](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/expand-a-cluster) or [Shrink a Cluster](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster) after installation.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/region-aware#_during_installation)During installation
Configuring a region-aware cluster is part of platform [installation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/installation/bare-metal-install).
This is an example `install.conf` that enables region-awareness for non-interactive installation.

   },
   "ReplicationFactor": 2
  }
 }
}

```

The configuration items that need to meet the conditions are
  * **RegionAware** should be `true`
  * **NodeList**
    * The number of nodes is more than 3
    * The format of all nodes is `Region:HostID:IP/HostName`
  * **ReplicationFactor** is greater than 1


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/region-aware#_after_installation)After installation
To enable region-awareness in an existing cluster, you can use [Cluster Expand](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/expand-a-cluster).
You can check whether the node information meets the requirements according to the output of the following command: ```
$ gadmin config get System.HostList![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!
```


Legal
```
[{"Hostname":"192.168.0.1","ID":"m1","Region":"us-east-1"}, {"Hostname":"192.168.0.2","ID":"m2","Region":"us-east-2"}, {"Hostname":"192.168.0.3","ID":"m3","Region":"us-east-3"}]javascript![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!
```


Illegal
```
[{"Hostname":"192.168.0.1","ID":"m1","Region":""}, {"Hostname":"192.168.0.2","ID":"m2","Region":""}, {"Hostname":"192.168.0.3","ID":"m3","Region":""}]javascript![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!
```
If any host does not contain region information, use the following command to add it: ```
$ gadmin config entry System.HostList
$ gadmin config apply -y![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!
```
  
---  
If you just want to enable region-aware without any other change, use the command following:
```
$ gadmin cluster expand --region-aware
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

If the existing cluster does not meet the prerequisites, you can also add nodes and modify replication factor with one command, example:
```
$ gadmin cluster expand us-east-3:m3:192.168.0.3,us-east-4:m4:192.168.0.4 --ha 2 --region-aware
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/region-aware#_disable_region_aware)Disable Region Aware
Disable region-awareness via [Cluster Expand](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/cluster-and-ha-management/expand-a-cluster)
```
$ gadmin cluster expand --region-aware=false
