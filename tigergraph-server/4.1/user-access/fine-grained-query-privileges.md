## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/user-access/fine-grained-query-privileges#_summary)Summary
In earlier versions of TigerGraph prior to 4.1, query privileges in TigerGraph are managed at the global and graph level with `READ_QUERY` and `WRITE_QUERY` privileges. For example, if a user has `READ_QUERY` privilege on graph `g1`, then the user can read any queries under graph `g1`. If a user has `WRITE_QUERY` privilege on global, then the user can create or replace any query under any graph in TigerGraph.
With fine-grained query privileges, the following changes will take effect:
  * `WRITE_QUERY` privilege is deprecated. It has been split into privileges such as `CREATE_QUERY`, `UPDATE_QUERY` and `DROP_QUERY`.
  * New privileges `INSTALL_QUERY`, `EXECUTE_QUERY` and `OWNERSHIP` are added.


`OWNERSHIP` is a special privilege introduced in version 4.1. It is granted automatically to the user who creates a query. The entity (a user or a role) who owns a query holds all privileges on a query. That means this entity can read, update, drop, install, and execute this query. An entity with `OWNERSHIP` privilege (e.g., the creator) on a query can grant privileges to other entities, including the `OWNERSHIP` privilege. Once the `OWNERSHIP` privilege is granted to another entity, the previous owner loses `OWNERSHIP` privilege on this query. Each object can have only one explicit owner entity. Users with the `superuser` role hold the `OWNERSHIP` privilege on all queries in all graphs implicitly. Users with the `admin` role in one graph hold the `OWNERSHIP` privilege on all queries in this graph implicitly.  
---  
  * Query privilege scope changes:
    * `CREATE_QUERY` privilege can only be granted/revoked at global and graph level.
    * `READ_QUERY`, `UPDATE_QUERY`, `DROP_QUERY`, `INSTALL_QUERY` and `EXECUTE_QUERY` privileges can only be granted/revoked at individual query level.
    * `OWNERSHIP` privilege can only be granted at the individual query level and only to one entity, e.g.: a user or a user-defined role.


With above changes, corresponding grant/revoke commands and query related operations are also changed. Details of such changes will be displayed in the following sections.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/user-access/fine-grained-query-privileges#_usage_examples)Usage Examples
We strongly recommend using object-based syntax for granting/revoking fine-grained query privileges.  
---  
Below are several commands for common use cases of granting/revoking fine-grained query privileges.
Example: Grant `CREATE` privilege at global level to role `r1`:
```
GSQL > GRANT CREATE ON ALL QUERIES IN GLOBAL to r1
The privilege "CREATE" is successfully granted on "ALL QUERIES" IN GLOBAL to role: r1
```

Note that `UPDATE` privilege depends on `READ` privilege. You need to grant `READ` before `UPDATE`, and revoke `UPDATE` before `READ`.
Example: Grant `READ` and `UDPATE` privileges on existing specific query objects `q1`, `q2` in graph `g1` to user `u1`:
```
GSQL > GRANT READ, UPDATE ON QUERY q1, q2 IN GRAPH g1 to u1
The privileges "READ, UPDATE" are successfully granted on "QUERY q1, q2" IN GRAPH g1 to user: u1
```

Example: Revoke `INSTALL` and `EXECUTE` privileges on all existing queries at global level from user `u1`:
```
GSQL > REVOKE INSTALL, EXECUTE ON ALL QUERIES IN GLOBAL FROM u1
The privileges "EXECUTE, INSTALL" are successfully revoked on "ALL QUERIES" IN GLOBAL from user: u1
```

If you want to revoke query privileges on specific existing query objects from a user or a role, make sure the user or role has the query privileges on all involved query objects.
Ex. Revoke `DROP` privileges on existing specific query objects `q1`, `q2` in graph `g1` from role `r1`:
```
// role r1 must already have DROP privilege on query q1, q2.
GSQL > REVOKE DROP ON QUERY q1, q2 IN GRAPH g1 FROM r1
The privilege "DROP" is successfully revoked on "QUERY q1, q2" IN GRAPH g1 from role: r1
```

For individual query level privileges, you can only grant/revoke on existing query objects.  
---  
Example: Grant `READ` and `UDPATE` privileges on existing queries `q1`, `q2` in graph `g1` to user `u1`, then create new query `q3`:
```
GSQL > use graph g1
GSQL > GRANT READ, UPDATE ON ALL QUERIES IN GRAPH g1 to u1
GSQL > show privilege on user u1
User: "u1"
 - Graph 'g1' Privileges:
   - Query 'q1' Privileges:
    READ_QUERY
    UPDATE_QUERY
   - Query 'q2' Privileges:
    READ_QUERY
    UPDATE_QUERY
GSQL > create query q3() for graph g1 {print "q3";}
GSQL > show privilege on user u1
User: "u1"
 - Graph 'g1' Privileges:
   - Query 'q1' Privileges:
    READ_QUERY
    UPDATE_QUERY
   - Query 'q2' Privileges:
    READ_QUERY
    UPDATE_QUERY
```

Example: Grant `OWNERSHIP` privilege on existing query q3 in graph `g1` to user `u1`:
```
GSQL > use graph g1
GSQL > GRANT OWNERSHIP ON QUERY q3 IN GRAPH g1 TO u1
Transfer the ownership of query q3 in graph g1 from entity tigergraph to entity u1
The privilege "OWNERSHIP" is successfully granted on "QUERY q3" IN GRAPH g1 to user: u1
GSQL > show privilege on user u1
User: "u1"
 - Graph 'g1' Privileges:
   - Query 'q1' Privileges:
    READ_QUERY
    UPDATE_QUERY
   - Query 'q2' Privileges:
    READ_QUERY
    UPDATE_QUERY
   - Query 'q3' Privileges:
    OWNER
```

After this step, `u1` becomes the owner of `q3` and owns all privileges on `q3`. `u1` can read, update, drop, install, and execute query `q3`. At the same time, `u1` can grant the query privileges to other entities, including the `OWNERSHIP` privilege.

With the introduction of new fine-grained query privileges, there are certain query privilege syntax usages become deprecated. If you still want to use them, you can control via adding/removing `ALLOW_LEGACY_RBAC_SYNTAX=true` in `GSQL.BasicConfig.Env`.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/user-access/fine-grained-query-privileges#_turn_onoff_legacy_rbac_syntax_usage)Turn On/Off Legacy RBAC Syntax Usage
Ex. Adding `ALLOW_LEGACY_RBAC_SYNTAX=true`
```
$ gadmin config get GSQL.BasicConfig.Env
CPATH=$CPATH; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
$ gadmin config set 'GSQL.BasicConfig.Env CPATH=$CPATH; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;ALLOW_LEGACY_RBAC_SYNTAX=true;'
$ gadmin config apply -y
$ gadmin restart gsql -y
```

Ex. Removing `ALLOW_LEGACY_RBAC_SYNTAX=true`
```
$ gadmin config get GSQL.BasicConfig.Env
CPATH=$CPATH; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; ALLOW_LEGACY_RBAC_SYNTAX=true;

    * `CREATE_QUERY` privilege will be granted on graph `g1` to role `r1`
    * `READ_QUERY`, `UPDATE_QUERY`, `DROP_QUERY`, `INSTALL_QUERY`, `EXECUTE_QUERY` privileges will be granted on all existing queries in graph `g1` to role `r1`.

  * `REVOKE PRIVILEGE READ_QUERY ON [GRAPH <graph_name> | GLOBAL ] FROM <role_name>`
    * Directly revoking `READ_QUERY` privilege in a graph or in global is no longer supported.
  * `REVOKE WRITE ON ALL QUERIES IN [GRAPH <graph_name> | GLOBAL] FROM <role_name>`
    * Directly revoking `WRITE` on all existing query objects in a graph or in all graphs is no longer supported.
