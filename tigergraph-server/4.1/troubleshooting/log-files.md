The TigerGraph database captures key information on activities occurring across its different components through log functions that output to log files. These log files are not only helpful in [troubleshooting](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide) but also serve as a resource for auditing. Logs may contain sensitive information, so direct access is restricted.
This page provides a general overview of the way log files are stored in TigerGraph.
[Audit logs](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/audit-log) are structured in JSON, ensuring machine-readability and facilitating easy integration with third-party tools. The TigerGraph Linux server admin user may also use the [gcollect](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/gcollect) utility to search for and gather selected information from the logs. We also provide instructions on how to [set up log viewing with Elasticsearch, Kibana, or Filebeat](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/elk-filebeat).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/log-files#_tigergraph_log_structure)TigerGraph log structure
Logs in TigerGraph are stored in TigerGraph’s log root directory, which is configured at install time. You can find the location by running the console command `gadmin config get System.LogRoot`.
Within this directory are separate directories for the various TigerGraph services:
```
$ ls /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log
admin    dict executor  gpe gsql informant kafkaconn   nginx    zk
controller etcd fileLoader gse gui  kafka   kafkastrm-ll restpp
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You can also use the `gadmin log` command to list log files:
```
$ gadmin log
ADMIN : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/admin/ADMIN#1.out
ADMIN : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/admin/ADMIN.INFO
CTRL  : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/controller/CTRL#1.log
CTRL  : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/controller/CTRL#1.out
...
ZK   : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/zk/ZK#1.out
ZK   : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/zk/zookeeper.log
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Use the command `gadmin log <service name>` to just get the logs for a specific service:
```
$ gadmin log gpe
GPE  : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/gpe/GPE_1#1.out
GPE  : /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log/gpe/log.INFO
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

The `log.INFO` file contains messages logged by the application code. The `.out` log contains the redirection of the process output, and is used for debugging significantly less frequently than `log.INFO`.
The log format differs between the `.out` and `INFO` logs. It also differs between certain TigerGraph services. An internal project to unify log formats is ongoing.   
---  
Log formats also vary across the different components. In folders where logs are checked often, such as `restpp`, `gsql`, and `admin`, there are symbolic links that help you quickly get to the most recent log file of that category:
  * `log.INFO`
    * Contains regular output and errors
  * `log.ERROR`
    * Contains errors only
  * `<component_name>.out`
    * Contains all output from the component process. Current `.out` logs have the form `<service name>.out`. Historical logs have the form `<service name>-old-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.fff.out`
  * `log.WARNING` or `log.DEBUG`
    * `log.WARNING` contains warnings and all error level messages
  * `log.FATAL`
    * Contains outputs for any fatal level events


All services do not create a `log.DEBUG` file by default. To change this, modify the parameter `<service>.BasicConfig.LogConfig.LogLevel`. For example, `GSQL.BasicConfig.LogConfig.LogLevel`. See [Configuration Parameters](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/reference/configuration-parameters) for more information.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/log-files#_log_locations_on_a_cluster)Log locations on a cluster
In a TigerGraph cluster, each node only keeps logs of activities that took place on the node itself. For example, the GSQL logs on the m1 node only record events for m1 and are not replicated across the cluster.
For GSQL specifically, the cluster elects a leader to which all GSQL requests will be forwarded. To check which node is the leader, start by checking the GSQL logs of the m1 node. Check the most recent lines of `log.INFO` and look for lines containing information about a leader switch.
For example, the logs below recorded a GSQL leader switch from m2 to m1:
```
I@20210709 13:56:52.214 (GsqlHAHandler.java:231) GSQL leader switches from 'm2' to 'm1' ...
E@20210709 13:56:52.215 (GsqlHAHandler.java:246) GSQL HA leader switches to 'm1', abort and clear all sessions now.
If you want to lower the chance of leader switch by increasing timeout, please use 'gadmin config' to increase 'Controller.LeaderElectionHeartBeatMaxMiss' and/or 'Controller.LeaderElectionHeartBeatIntervalMS'.
I@20210709 13:56:52.219 (SessionManager.java:197) Abort and clear all sessions...
I@20210709 13:56:52.220 (SessionManager.java:204) All sessions aborted.
I@20210709 13:56:52.224 (GsqlHAHandler.java:283) switched to new leader m1

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/log-files#_open_source_tigergraph_components)Open source TigerGraph components
The open source components that TigerGraph includes (Kafka, Nginx, ZooKeeper, Kafkaconn, Kafkastream) follow their respective logging behavior instead of having an `INFO/WARNING/ERROR` log, in addition to having an `.out` file for process output redirection. For example, the Kafka logs have a `controller.log`, `kafka.log`, `kafka-request.log`, `state-change.log`, and `server.log`.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.1/troubleshooting/log-files#_log_rotation)Log rotation
TigerGraph also handles log rotation. When the log is rotated, the log.LEVEL symlink is updated to point to the newest log. The default configuration is to rotate under any of the following circumstances:
  * Log file max size exceeds 100mb
  * Log is older than 90 days
  * There are more than 100 files for that service
