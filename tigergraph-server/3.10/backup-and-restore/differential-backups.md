## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/backup-and-restore/differential-backups#_terminology_definition)Terminology Definition
Full backups comprise entire data backup sets, regardless of already existing backups or data change circumstances.
  * Differential backups backup Kafka messages that have changed since the most recently completed or most recently restored full backup.


For example, a full backup happened at `tid:100`, a schema change happened at `tid:150` and a differential backup happened at `tid:200`.
Additionally, for example, if you have _full backup A_ and _full backup B_ , _full backup A_ happened before _full backup B_. If you restore _full backup A_ , then the next differential backup is based on _full backup A_ , instead of _full backup B_ , although _full backup B_ was completed more recently.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/backup-and-restore/differential-backups#_how_differential_backup_works)How Differential Backup works
To illustrate how differential backup works, take into account the user scenario below.
Example 1. User Scenario
  1. A user creates a full backup every _Sunday_ (Or Day `N`).
  2. During the week, between the two full backup days (_Sunday_ and _Next Sunday_) TigerGraph provides differential backups for every change since that first full backup.
  3. A differential backup is taken until the backup data is as large as the backup on _Sunday_
  4. Another full backup is taken on _Next Sunday_ and the circle repeats steps 2-4.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/backup-and-restore/differential-backups#_enable_differential_backup)Enable Differential Backup
If a user wants to make differential backups based on a full backup they have made, they should run: `gadmin backup create <tag>` with the `--incremental` flag.
Ex.
```
gadmin backup create <tag> --incremental
```

For more details on `gadmin backup create` see [Back up a Database Cluster Procedure](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/backup-and-restore/backup-cluster#_procedure).  
---  
To restore a differential backup, users need to find the correct `<tag>` from the backup list. To see the list of backups, run:
Ex.
```
gadmin backup list
```

![backup list](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/backup-and-restore/_images/backup_list.png)
Figure 1. `gadmin backup list` example result.
This will list all the backup tags. Notice the type column in the result. This is how users can identify which backups are `FULL` or not. To restore the specific backup, run:
Ex.
```
gadmin backup restore <specifc backup tag>
```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/backup-and-restore/differential-backups#_disable_differential_backup)Disable Differential Backup
If a user wants to make a full backup _**WITHOUT**_ differential backup enabled, they can do so by excluding the `--incremental` flag in `gadmin backup create`.
Ex.
```
gadmin backup create <tag>
```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/backup-and-restore/differential-backups#_limitations)Limitations
Differential backup does have some know limitations:
  * Kafka reset or Kafka purging of large amounts of Kafka message data is not yet supported by differential backups.
  * Differential Backup must based on last full snapshot backup and cannot be based on a previous days differential backup.
    * For example: If a user did a full backup on _Sunday_ and then one differential backup on _Monday_. Then, if the user wants to run a differential backup on _Tuesday_ , they will have to base it on _Sunday’s_ full backup and save all changes since then. So part of your _Tuesday_ differential backup is actually the same as _Monday’s_.
