### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/loading-concurrency#_number_of_concurrent_loading_jobs)Number of concurrent loading jobs
By default, only one loading job may run at a time. Additional job requests are held in a wait queue. You can increase the number of concurrent active jobs by changing the following configurations:
For **local file loading** :
```
$ gadmin config set FileLoader.ReplicaNumber <new_limit>
$ gadmin config apply -y && gadmin restart gse gpe restpp -y
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

For **Kafka Loader loading** :
```
$ gadmin config set KafkaLoader.ReplicaNumber <new_limit>
$ gadmin config apply -y && gadmin restart gse gpe restpp -y
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/loading-concurrency#_allowed_resources_for_loading)Allowed resources for loading
You can also configure how many resources are permitted to work on loading jobs.
**Tasks per CPU** (for KafkaConnect)
This parameter sets the average CPU workload per server, in a distributed cluster. The allowed range is [0.5, 10], but we recommend going no higher than 2. The default value is 1.5. In a 4-server cluster, that means the maximum number of Kafka connector tasks is
0.5 * 4 = 2.
If you get an error message saying that the Connector has hit the upper limit on the number of tasks, you can slightly increase the limit to allow more connector tasks.
```
$ gadmin config set KafkaConnect.AllowedTaskPerCPU <new_limit>
$ gadmin config apply -y && gadmin restart kafkaconn -y
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```
