## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/avro-validation-with-kafka#_overview)Overview
In certain scenarios, users could load data in Avro format to TigerGraph DB, via an external Kafka connector, such as MirrorMakerConnector and experience malformed data errors during this process. This generated vague error messages and loading failures.
The KafkaConnect feature flag `ErrorTolerance` and the new transformations enables data loading services to handle malformed data and report errors effectively.
The KafkaConnect feature flag was introduced in 3.10.0.  
---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/avro-validation-with-kafka#_errortolerance)`ErrorTolerance`
`ErrorTolerance` can now be set to `none` or `all`.
In `errorTolance=none` mode, it will throw an exception to stop data loading immediately.
In `errorTolerance=all` mode, the loading process continues even in the presence of malformed data. New converters, specifically KafkaConnect transformations, are introduced to manage errors, recording error stack messages in headers. The KafkaLoader reports these errors to KafkaStrm-LL and proceeds to process the subsequent records. Users can query the loading job status to view error messages related to failed records when `errorTolerance=all` mode is active.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/avro-validation-with-kafka#_types_of_avro_transformation)Types of Avro Transformation
Two new Avro transformations are available:
Transformation | Notes  
---|---  
`TigergraphAvroWithSchemaRegistryTransformation` | A schema registry (URL) is required. See note below.  
`TigergraphAvroWithoutSchemaRegistryTransformation` | A schema registry is **not** required.  
For `TigergraphAvroWithSchemaRegistryTransformation`, users need to set up a web service exposing this URL. The Avro message will contain a `scheme ID`, the Transformation (or previous converter) will fetch the schema with the `schema ID` via the URL.  
---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/avro-validation-with-kafka#_how_to_enable_avro_data_validation)How to Enable Avro Data Validation
To enable Avro data validation, configure Kafka Connector with `ErrorTolerance` and the new transformation.
Below are the additional settings to be added to the connector config:
```
connector.class=org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorSourceConnector
...
key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter
header.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.converters.ByteArrayConverter
transforms=TigerGraphAvroTransform
transforms.TigerGraphAvroTransform.type=com.tigergraph.kafka.connect.transformations.TigergraphAvroWithSchemaRegistryTransformation
transforms.TigerGraphAvroTransform.schema.registry.url=<URL to schema registry>
transforms.TigerGraphAvroTransform.errors.tolerance=all

```

  * In the above settings, `MirrorSourceConnector` is the connector.
  * The transformation type is set to `TigergraphAvroWithSchemaRegistryTransformation,` but alternatively, it could be set to `TigergraphAvroWithoutSchemaRegistryTransformation.`

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/avro-validation-with-kafka#_old_schema_vs_new_schema)Old Schema vs. New Schema:
Below are examples of the old schema and the new changes.
Old schema:
```
{"type":"record", "name":"companyInfo", "fields": [{"name": "company", "type": "string"}]}'
```

Old data:
```
{"company":"TigerGraph"}
```

New Schema:
```
{"type":"record","name":"companyInfo","fields":[{"name":"company","type":"string"},{"name":"employeeNum","type":"int"}]}
```

Example data added to Avro file:
```
{"company":"Tigergraph","employeeNum":23456}
```

KafkaConnect currently employing mm2 (MirrorMaker 2), encounters an issue when using the `TigergraphAvroWithSchemaRegistryTransformation` with a new schema. With the introduction of the new schema and transformation a failure occurs in converting older data that does not include the expected `employeeNum` field.  
---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.10/data-loading/avro-validation-with-kafka#_how_to_show_data_malformation_errors)How to Show Data Malformation Errors
Here is an example command to query loading status:
```
curl -s http://$(gmyip):$(gadmin config get KafkaStreamLL.Port)/log-aggregation/local/loading-progress
```

If data malformation exists, the result will display errors aiding users in identifying problematic files or records, including:
  * `errorCode: 55`
  * Other error messages containing error stacks.
