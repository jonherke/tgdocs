TigerGraph Graph Administrator (`gadmin`) is a tool for managing TigerGraph servers.
To see a listing of all the options or commands available for gadmin, see the [Command Glossary](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/system-management/management-commands) page.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/system-management/management-with-gadmin#_manage_licenses)Manage licenses
To add a new license key, use the command `gadmin license set`. You can either paste the license key in the terminal directly, or use the `@` symbol to point to a specific file path.
  * `gadmin license set <new_license_key>`
  * `gadmin license set @<path_to_license_file>`


To simply check the status of the license on the current solution, use the command `gadmin license status`.
See [Advanced License Issues](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/installation/license) for a complete guide to activating or renewing a TigerGraph license.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/system-management/management-with-gadmin#_manage_system_configurations)Manage system configurations
In addition to the environment variables controlling memory thresholds, TigerGraph has many other environment variables that can be used to configure system parameters.
Examples of parameters that can be changed with these commands include:
  * Size and number of log files kept
  * System root directory
  * Timeout length
  * Port numbers
  * [Replica numbers](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/cluster-and-ha-management/crr-index)


See [Configuration Parameters](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/reference/configuration-parameters) for a full list of these parameters. All of them can be accessed with the `gadmin config` command.
