Shrinking a cluster removes nodes from the cluster. The data stored on those nodes will be redistributed to the remaining nodes.
Shrinking a cluster can make sense for a few reasons:
  * Your workload has changed and you can operate a cluster with fewer resources.
  * Your data volume is lower than projected.


Shrinking an operational cluster is different from removing a failed node. If a node has failed in your cluster and needs to be removed, see [Removal of Failed Nodes](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/remove-failed-node).
Cluster shrinking requires several minutes of cluster downtime. The exact amount of downtime varies depending on the size of your cluster.

Requirements
  * Ensure that no loading jobs, queries, or REST requests are running on the new node or the cluster.

  
---  
Advice and Precautions
  * Obtain a few key measures for the state of your data before the expansion, such as vertex counts/edge counts or certain query results. This will be useful in verifying data integrity after the expansion completes.
  * Perform a full backup of your existing system before performing the expansion.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster#_procedure)2. Procedure
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster#_identify_new_cluster_replication_and_partition)2.1. Identify new cluster replication and partition
Before running any commands to shrink a cluster, make sure you have a clear idea of how the new cluster should be distributed. You should have the following information:
  * The new replication factor of the cluster
  * The new partitioning factor of the cluster
  * The names and IP addresses of the nodes to be removed from the cluster


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster#_shrink_the_cluster)2.2. Shrink the cluster
To shrink the cluster, run the `gadmin cluster shrink` command like below. If the shrinking involves changing the replication factor, use the `--ha <replicattion_factor>` option to indicate the new replication factor:
```
$ gadmin cluster shrink node_ip_list [--ha <replication_factor>]
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

`node_ip_list` is the list of nodes you are removing from the cluster mapped to their IP addresses with a colon(`:`), and separated by a comma. Below is an example:
```
$ gadmin cluster shrink m3:10.128.0.81,m4:10.128.0.82 --ha 1
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster#_supply_a_staging_location)2.2.1. Supply a staging location
Extra disk space is required during cluster shrinking. If more space is not available on the same disk, you can supply a staging location on a different disk to hold temporary data:
```
$ gadmin cluster shrink m3:192.168.1.3,m4:192.168.1.4 --stagingPath /tmp/
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

If you choose to supply a staging location, make sure that the TigerGraph Linux user has write permission to the path you provide. The overall amount of space required for cluster shrinking on each node is `(1 + ceiling(oldPartition/newPartition) ) * dataRootSize`. `oldPartition` and `newPartition` stand for the partitioning factors of the cluster before and after shrinking, respectively; `dataRootSize` stands for the size of the data root folder on the node.
For example, assume you are shrinking from a 10-node cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 5, to a 6-node cluster with a replication factor of 2 and a partitioning factor of 3, and the size of the data root folder on a node is 50GB. You would need more than `(1 + ceiling(5/3)) * 50) = 150 GB` of free space on the staging path.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster#_verify_success_and_delete_temporary_files)2.3. Verify success and delete temporary files
When shrinking completes, you should see a message confirming the completion of the cluster change. The message will also include the location of the temporary files created during the operation.
Verify data integrity by comparing vertex/edge counts or query results to what they were before the shrinking. After confirming a successful cluster contraction, delete the temporary files to free up disk space.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/cluster-and-ha-management/shrink-a-cluster#_uninstall_tigergraph_on_the_removed_nodes)2.4. Uninstall TigerGraph on the removed nodes
Uninstall TigerGraph from the removed nodes by removing all root directories (`app`, `data` and `tmp`) except the log directory of TigerGraph.
For security reasons, `guninstall` is disabled on the removed nodes. Therefore, you need to delete TigerGraph by manually deleting the root directories.
