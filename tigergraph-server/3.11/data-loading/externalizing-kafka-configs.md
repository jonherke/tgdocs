Users can utilize external sources, including files, vault, and environment variables, to provide configurations for Kafka connectors when [Loading data from Kafka](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/load-from-kafka).
Sensitive information such as credentials and security setups are kept secure. For more information on Kafka security see [Kafka Connect Security Basics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/security.html#externalize-secrets).

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_disallowed)Disallowed
Some configs are not allowed to be externalized because there is a dependency in TigerGraph:
  * `task.max`
  * `topic`
  * `connector.class`
  * `mode`
  * `name (connector name)`
  * `source.cluster.alias`
  * `topics (in MirrorMaker connector)`
  * `num.partitions`


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_config_providers)Config Providers
Users can specify config provider type and class from the [Kafka ConfigProvider API](https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.5.1/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/common/config/provider/ConfigProvider.html) along with the parameters config providers need.
The format `${<config-provider-type>:<path>:<key>}` is used to replace a config value in the config file. The config provider will automatically look up the referred source and find the value corresponding to the `<path>` and `<key>`.
Config Provider | Config Provider Type `config.providers` | Config Provider class `config.providers.<type>.class` | Config Provider Reference `${<config-provider-type>:<path>:<key>}`  
---|---|---|---  
[File Config Provider](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_file_config_provider) | file | org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.FileConfigProvider | `${file:<path-to-file>:<key>}`  
[Environment Variable Config Provider](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_environment_variable_config_provider) | env | org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.EnvVarConfigProvider | `${env:<key>} (no path needed)`  
[Vault Config Provider](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_vault_config_provider) | vault | org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.EnvVarConfigProvider | `${vault:<vault-path>:<key>}`  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_file_config_provider)File Config Provider
Allows users to put secrets and other config items in a separate file.
The file must exist in the same path on all nodes of the cluster.  
---  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_example_usage)Example usage
Example secret file `secret.properties`:
```
S3_ACCESS_KEY=thisisakey
S3_SECRET_KEY=anotherkey
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Example stream loading job config file:
```
{
"type": "s3",
"access.key":"${file:/tmp/secret.properties:S3_ACCESS_KEY}",
"secret.key":"${file:/tmp/secret.properties:S3_SECRET_KEY}",
config.providers=file,
config.providers.file.class=org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.FileConfigProvider
}

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_environment_variable_config_provider)Environment Variable Config Provider
Allows users to use an environment variable as values in configuration.
The environment variable should be added to KafkaConnect using `gadmin config set KafkaConnect.BasicConfig.Env`.
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_example_usage_2)Example Usage
Set environment variable (bash)
```
# Format details:
# The secrets should be ';' separated and in format "key=value".
# The values will be read as is and no escaping (\n for example) or quotes (' or ") are needed.
# Key names should follow bash variable name standards, ie, no special characters other than '_'.
secrets="S3_ACCESS_KEY=password; S3_SECRET_KEY=password;"
gadmin config set KafkaConnect.BasicConfig.Env "$(gadmin config get KafkaConnect.BasicConfig.Env); $secrets"
gadmin config apply -y
gadmin restart kafkaconn -y

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_vault_config_provider)Vault Config Provider
Allows users to use vault as a source for config values. Please follow vault setup guide on their the [Official Documentations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-deploy).
There are additional config parameters for vault config provider.
Table 1. Additional Vault Configurations: Configuration Key | Default Value | Description  
---|---|---  
vault.max.retries | 5 | The number of times that API operations will be retried when a failure occurs.  
vault.retry.interval.ms | 2000 | The number of milliseconds that the driver will wait in between retries.  
vault.address | Sets the address (URL) of the Vault server instance to which API calls should be sent. If not explicitly set, it will look to the VAULT_ADDR environment variable. If not found, initialization may fail.  
vault.prefix | Sets a prefix that will be added to all paths, allowing the same configuration settings to be used across multiple environments.  
vault.namespace | Sets a global namespace to the Vault server instance, if desired.  
vault.token | Sets the token used to access Vault. If not explicitly set, the VAULT_TOKEN environment variable will be used.  
vault.login.by | Token | The login method to use. Currently, only supports Token.  
vault.ssl.verify.enabled | true | Flag to determine if the configuration provider should verify the SSL Certificate of the Vault server. Outside of development, this should never be disabled.  
vault.ssl.cert | The path of a classpath resource containing an X.509 certificate, in unencrypted PEM format with UTF-8 encoding. Must be available on all nodes in the cluster.  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.11/data-loading/externalizing-kafka-configs#_example_usage_3)Example Usage
Example vault server config with HTTPS enabled:
```
storage "file" {
  path  = "<vault_data_root>"
}
listener "tcp" {
  address   = "<ip>:<vault_port>"
  tls_disable = "false"
  tls_cert_file = "<cert>"
  tls_key_file = "<key>"
}
api_addr = "<VAULT_ADDR>"
cluster_addr = "https://<ip>:<vault_cluster_port>"
ui = true
disable_mlock = true
