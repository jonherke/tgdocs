This tutorial will show you how to start TigerGraph from an image on Google Cloud.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/cloud-images/gcp#_deploying_your_instance)Deploying Your Instance
  1. Go to [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace) and search for "TigerGraph Enterprise Edition". Choose the latest edition to access the most up-to-date features.
  2. Click **Launch**.
  3. Review the default settings and see if they fit your needs. When ready, click **Deploy**.
     * The instance type needs to have at least 4 CPUs and 16GB RAM for TigerGraph to work properly.
     * You must allow internet traffic for TCP port 14240 if you want to access GraphStudio. For more about GraphStudio, see the [GraphStudio UI Guide](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/graphstudio/overview).
     * You must allow internet traffic for TCP port 9000 if you want to use TigerGraph’s REST API (this includes configuring the GSQL client on a remote machine).
![deploy form](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/_images/deploy-form.png)
  4. That’s it! The TigerGraph instance has been successfully deployed on Google Cloud.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/cloud-images/gcp#_starting_tigergraph_on_your_instance)Starting TigerGraph on Your Instance
  1. Log into the instance and switch to user `tigergraph` using the following command:
```
$ sudo su - tigergraph
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  2. Run the following command to check the current status of TigerGraph. The services **"ADMIN", "CTRL", "ETCD", "IFM", "KAFKA", and "ZK" are started automatically** and are online at this point. If any of them are down, **please wait for 30 to 60 seconds and check the status again**.
```
gadmin status
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

![gadmin status \(3\)](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/_images/gadmin-status%20\(3\).png)
  3. Run the following command to start TigerGraph:
```
$ gadmin start
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  4. Check the status again. All services are online at this point. It is normal for GPE and GSE to be in warmup when the database is empty.
```
$ gadmin status
