This tutorial will show you how to start TigerGraph Enterprise Edition from an image on Microsoft Azure.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/cloud-images/azure#_deploying_your_instance)**Deploying Your Instance**
  1. Go to link: [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home) and search for "TigerGraph".
  2. Select your software plan and Click "Create". Select the latest plan (with the highest version number) to access the latest features.
![Azure Create Page](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/_images/create-page%20\(1\).png)
  3. Fill out the "Resource group", "Virtual machine name", "Username" and "SSH Public key" fields. The default values should work for the rest of the fields. Then click "**Next: Disks >**".
![Azure Basic Settings Page](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/_images/basic-settings-page%20\(1\).png)
  4. Keep the default values for all other settings and click "Next" until you see the "Review + Create" page below. Check all your settings and click "Create" when you are satisfied.
The instance type needs to have at least 4 CPUs and 16GB RAM for TigerGraph to work properly.   
---  
The "NIC network security group" must allow inbound TCP traffic to port 14240 if you want to access GraphStudio (TigerGraph’s visualization platform). For more about GraphStudio, see the [GraphStudio UI Guide](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/graphstudio/overview).
The "NIC network security group" must allow inbound TCP traffic to port 9000 if you want to send RESTful requests to TigerGraph from outside the instance (this includes configuring the GSQL client on a remote machine). For more about the REST API, see the [TigerGraph RESTful API User Guide](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/API/).
For more about the TigerGraph Platform, see the [TigerGraph Platform Overview](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/intro/).
![Azure Review Page](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/_images/review-page%20\(1\).png)
  5. That’s it! The TigerGraph instance has been successfully deployed on Microsoft Azure.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/getting-started/cloud-images/azure#_starting_tigergraph_on_your_instance)**Starting TigerGraph on Your Instance**
  1. Log on to the instance and switch to user `tigergraph` using the following command:
