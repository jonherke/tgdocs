# List of Ports
This page lists all ports that TigerGraph uses.
TigerGraph requires three external ports to be exposed: 22, 9000, and 14240. All other ports are used for internal communication within a cluster and must be open within the cluster.
Port Description | Port | Note  
---|---|---  
22 | SSH port | Internal and external use  
2888-2892 | Port for Zookeeper to do peer communication | Max 5 Zookeeper servers  
3888-3892 | Port for Zookeeper to do leader election | Max 5 Zookeeper servers  
5400 | Port of RESTPP to accept GPE response  
5500 | Port of RESTPP to accept GSE response  
6500 | ID request serving port of GSE  
7500 | GPE port for receiving id response from GSE  
7501 | GPE port for receiving response back from other GPEs  
7502 | GPE port for receiving requests  
8123-8124 | Server port for GSQL  
8400-8401 | FileLoader ports to accept GPE response  
8500-8501 | FileLoader ports to accept GSE response  
8900 | Serving port for GSE RLS  
9000 | Port of RESTPP to accept upstream Nginx requests | External use only  
9166 | gRPC server port for Informant  
9167 | RESTful server port for Informant  
9177 | Serving port for Executor  
9178 | File transfer port for Executor  
9188 | Serving port for Controller  
9400-9401 | Port of KafkaLoader to accept GPE response  
9500-9501 | Port of KafkaLoader to accept GSE response  
10000 | RESTPP’s http server port  
12471 | Port for Admin  
14240 | Serving port for Nginx | External use only  
14241 | GUI GraphStudio websocket port  
14242 | Serving port for GraphStudio Websocket communication  
14243 | GUI Admin Portal websocket port  
17797 | Port for Dict  
19000 | RESTful API port for TS3Server  
19001 | gRPC API port for TS3Server  
19999 | Serving port for Zookeeper  
20000 | Port of ETCD to listen for client traffic  
20001 | Port of ETCD to listen for peer traffic  
30002 | Serving port for Kafka  
30004 | Port used for Kafka stream LoadingLog  
30003 | Port used for Kafka connect  
49152 - 65535 | Dynamic ports | Required for backup and restore as well as communication between TigerGraph services.  
Under ports for internal communication, they are also the **dynamic ports** (aka ephemeral ports) that are used for only a short period of time for the duration of a communication session. Such short-lived ports are allocated automatically within a predefined range (in TigerGraph case from 49152 to 65535) of port numbers by the OS. After completion of the session, the port is destroyed and the port number becomes available for reuse.
