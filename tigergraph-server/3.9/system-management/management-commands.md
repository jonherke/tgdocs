Description:
 If you want to make this automatic, add ". <(gadmin autocomplete bash)" to your
 .bashrc file.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_backup_retain)gadmin backup retain
The `retain` command does cleaning for backups whose tags match the given <TagPrefix>.
```
$ gadmin backup retain -h
Usage:
 gadmin backup retain <TagPrefix> [-c] [-d] [flags]
Description:
 The 'retain' command applies backup cleaning logic only to the backups that match
 the given <TagPrefix>.
 Specifically, the cleaning is done by keeping backups files matching the
 following conditions:
 (1) Backups that do NOT contain the given tag prefix
 (2) Backups that contain the given tag prefix but:
 (a) it is one of the most recent 'count' backups within the same prefix group;
 (b) the age of backup is within 'duration'.
 E.g. the following command keeps the most recent 10 backups within 10 days for
 backups starting with the prefix "week":
 gadmin backup retain week -c 10 -d 240h
 other backups with a name starting with the prefix "week" will be removed.
Flags:
 -c, --count int     Being one of the most recent <count> backups. (default -1)
   --dry-run      dry run and output the retain result
 -d, --duration string
             The age of backup is within <duration>.
             A duration string should be an unsigned sequence of decimal numbers,
             each with an optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m".
             Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
 -h, --help       help for retain
 -y, --y         yes to all questions

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_start)gadmin start
The `gadmin start` command can be used to start one, many, or all services.
```
$ gadmin start -h
Start services by service id
Usage:
 gadmin start [serviceID...] [flags]
Description:
 ServiceID should be [serviceName][_partition][#replica], e.g., GSE_1#3. Leave
 replica field empty(e.g. GSE_1) to either refer to all replicas of given
 partition, or if the service has no replicas(e.g. EXE_1). Same for parititons.
 If no serviceID is specified, it only starts services excluding the
 infrastructure. Use 'gadmin start all' to start all services.
Flags:
   --auto-restart     auto restart the service on crash
   --dry-run       dry run and output command to start the service
 -h, --help         help for start
   --ignore-error     ignore errors when starting services
   --no-dep        start service without dependency
   --timeout int     request timeout(in MilliSecond) to start the service
   --wait-online     wait until the services go online, the time limit can be specified by '--timeout'
   --with-config string  start with given config file and dump it to each node (only for executor)
Global Flags:
   --debug  enable debug log output to stdout

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_status)gadmin status
Check the status of TigerGraph component servers:
```
$ gadmin status -h
Show current status of service
Usage:
 gadmin status [serviceID...] [flags]
Description:
 ServiceID should be [serviceName][_partition][#replica], e.g., GSE_1#3. Leave
 replica field empty(e.g. GSE_1) to either refer to all replicas of given
 partition, or if the service has no replicas(e.g. EXE_1). Same for parititons.
 If no serviceID is specified, it will show all service status
Flags:
 -h, --help   help for status
 -v, --verbose  report service status in detail
Global Flags:
   --debug  enable debug log output to stdout

Use **`gadmin status`**to report whether each of the main component servers is running (up) or stopped (off). The example below shows the normal status when the graph store is empty and a graph schema has not been defined:
```
$ gadmin status
+--------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
|  Service Name  |   Service Status   |   Process State   |
+--------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
|    ADMIN    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    CTRL    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    DICT    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    ETCD    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    GPE     |     Online     |     Running     |
|    GSE     |     Online     |     Running     |
|    GSQL    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    GUI     |     Online     |     Running     |
|    IFM     |     Online     |     Running     |
|    KAFKA    |     Online     |     Running     |
|   KAFKACONN   |     Online     |     Running     |
|  KAFKASTRM-LL  |     Online     |     Running     |
|    NGINX    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    RESTPP    |     Online     |     Running     |
|    TS3     |     Online     |     Running     |
|   TS3SERV    |     Online     |     Running     |
|     ZK     |     Online     |     Running     |
+--------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

```

You can also check the status of each instance using the verbose flag : `gadmin status -v` or `gadmin status --verbose`. This will show each machine’s status. See example below
```
$ gadmin status -v GPE
+--------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
|  Service Name  |   Service Status   |   Process State   |
+--------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
|   GPE_1#1    |     Warmup     |     Running     |
|   GPE_1#2    |     Warmup     |     Running     |
+--------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

Here are the most common service and process status states you might see from running the `gadmin status` command :
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_service_status_definitions)Service Status Definitions
  * **Online** - The service is online and ready.
  * **Warmup** - The service is processing the graph information and will be online soon.
  * **Stopping** - The service has received a stop command and will be down soon.
  * **Offline** - The service is not available.
  * **Down** - The service has been stopped or crashed.
  * **StatusUnknown** - The valid status of the service is not tracked.


#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_process_state_status_definitions)Process State Status Definitions
  * **Init** - Process is initializing and will be in the running state soon.
  * **Running** - The process is running and available.
  * **Zombie** - There is a leftover process from a previous instance.
  * **Stopped** - The process has been stopped or crashed.
  * **StatusUnknown** - The valid status of the process is not tracked.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_stop)gadmin stop
The `gadmin stop` command can be used to stop one, many, or all TigerGraph services. You will need to confirm the restarting of services by either entering y (yes) or n (no). To bypass this prompt, you can use the -y flag to force confirmation.
```
$ gadmin stop -h
Stop services by service id
Usage:
 gadmin stop [serviceID...] [flags]
Description:
 ServiceID should be [serviceName][_partition][#replica], e.g., GSE_1#3. Leave
 replica field empty(e.g. GSE_1) to either refer to all replicas of given
 partition, or if the service has no replicas(e.g. EXE_1). Same for parititons.
 If no serviceID is specified, it only stops services excluding the
 infrastructure. Use 'gadmin stop all' to stop all services.
Flags:
 -y, --confirm    confirm to stop service
 -h, --help      help for stop
   --ignore-error  ignore errors when stoping services
   --timeout int  request timeout(in MilliSecond) to stop the service
Global Flags:
   --debug  enable debug log output to stdout

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_version)gadmin version
```
$ gadmin version -h
Show the version information
Usage:
 gadmin version [flags]
Description:
 Show version information of all TigerGraph components, including repo name,
 version, git commit number, git commit datetime.
Flags:
 -h, --help  help for version
Global Flags:
   --debug  enable debug log output to stdout
