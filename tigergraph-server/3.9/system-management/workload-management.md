Certain TigerGraph operations, such as running online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that touch a lot of data, can be memory-intensive. TigerGraph provides the following mechanisms for you to manage workload in your TigerGraph instances.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_limit_number_of_current_built_in_heavy_queries)Limit number of current built-in heavy queries
TigerGraph has a few built-in queries that are memory-intensive, here referred to as "heavy". These queries tend to be invoked by applications such as GraphStudio. You can set a limit of how many of these heavy queries are allowed to run concurrently by configuring the parameter `RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxHeavyBuiltinQueries` with the [`gadmin config` command](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_config).
For example, to set the maximum number of heavy built-in queries to 10, run the following command:
```
$ gadmin config set RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxHeavyBuiltinQueries 10
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You must [restart the RESTPP service](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/manage-services#_start_stop_or_restart_a_service) for the change to take effect.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_limit_number_of_concurrent_queries)Limit number of concurrent queries
You can use the `RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxConcurrentQueries` parameter to set a limit of how many queries are allowed to be running concurrently. The count of these queries **does not include** the built-in heavy queries.
For example, to specify that there can only be 50 concurrent queries at a time, excluding the heavy built-in queries, change the value of the configuration parameter to 50 with the [`gadmin config` command](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/management-commands#_gadmin_config):
```
$ gadmin config set RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxConcurrentQueries 50

```

If the maximum number of concurrent queries is reached, newly submitted queries are placed in a delay queue, and begin to run as the currently running queries finish. If the queue is at capacity, newly submitted queries are rejected. and you need wait until there is capacity to run the query again. You can adjust the size of the queue with the configuration parameter `RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxDelayQueueSize`.
For example, to specify that a maximum 20 queries may remain in the queue, run the following command:
```
$ gadmin config set RESTPP.WorkLoadManager.MaxDelayQueueSize 20

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_specify_number_of_threads_used_by_a_query)Specify number of threads used by a query
You can specify the limit of the number of threads that can be used by one query through the [Run Query REST endpoint](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/built-in-endpoints#_run_an_installed_query_post).
For example, to specify a limit of four threads that can be used by a query, use the `GSQL-THREAD-LIMIT` parameter and set its value to 4:
Specify that the query run with a limit of 4 threads
```
curl -X POST -H "GSQL-THREAD-LIMIT: 4" -d '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}' "http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_query_routing_schemes)Query Routing Schemes
In a distributed or replicated cluster, REST++ automatically routes queries to different GPEs, in order to spread the workload.
If [GSQL-REPLICA](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_specify_replica_to_run_query_on) header is used when invoking a query, this header overrides the routing scheme for that query.   
---  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_round_robin_routing)Round Robin routing
The default query routing scheme is round-robin. The first query is managed by GPE 0, the next query by GPE 1, and so on. After the last GPE, the cycle returns to GPE 0.
Version 3.9.3 adds a system configuration parameter `RESTPP.CPULoadAware.Mode` to enable system administrators to select other query routing schemes:
  * Mode = 0 (default): Round-Robin
  * Mode = 1: CPU Load Aware


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_cpu_load_aware_query_routing)CPU Load Aware Query Routing
When this query routing mode is selected, REST++ tries to direct incoming queries to the GPEs that are currently less busy.
Specifically, the system periodically polls CPU usage data to find a GPE whose CPU usage percentage is below `RESTPP.QueryRouting.TargetSelectionCPUThreshold` (default 50).
If no GPE satisfies the CPU threshold condition, REST++ falls back to the default behavior (round-robin selection).
Example: Change CPU Load Threshold and Enable CPU Load Aware routing
```
$ gadmin config entry RESTPP.QueryRouting.TargetSelectionCPUThreshold 40
$ gadmin config entry RESTPP.QueryRouting.Mode 1

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/workload-management#_specify_replica_to_run_query_on)Specify replica to run query on
On a distributed cluster, you can specify on which replica you want a query to be run through the [Run Query REST endpoint](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/built-in-endpoints#_run_an_installed_query_post).
For example, to run the query on the primary cluster, use the `GSQL-REPLICA` header when running a query and set its value to 1:
Specify that the query run on the primary cluster
```
curl -X POST -H "GSQL-REPLICA: 1" -d '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}'
"http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"
