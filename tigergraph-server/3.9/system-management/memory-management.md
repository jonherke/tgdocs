This page explains the key factors that affect memory usage in TigerGraph, as well as how to:
  * Monitor memory usage
  * Configure memory thresholds
  * Manage query workload distribution


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_memory_usage_key_factors)Memory usage key factors
Below are the major factors that impact memory usage in TigerGraph:
  * Data volume
    * The biggest factor that affects memory usage in TigerGraph is the amount of data you have. Most database operations require more memory the more data you have.
  * Queries
    * Queries that read or write a high volume of data use more memory.
    * In a distributed cluster, a non-distributed query can be memory-intensive for the node where the query is run. See [Distributed Query Mode](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/3.9/querying/distributed-query-mode).


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_monitor_memory_usage)Monitor memory usage
You can monitor memory usage by query and by machine.

TigerGraph’s Graph Processing Engine (GPE) records memory usage by query at different stages of the query and saves it to the GPE logs at `$(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO`. This is an estimation of the query’s memory usage **on a particular node** in a TigerGraph cluster.
The log levels are set with the `gadmin` configuration command `GPE.BasicConfig.LogConfig.LogLevel`, which has the values `OFF`, `BRIEF (default)`, `DEBUG`, and `VERBOSE`.
You can monitor how much memory a query is using by searching the log file for the request ID and filter for lines that contain `"QueryMem"`:
```
$ grun all 'grep -i <request_id> $(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO | grep -i "querymem"'
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You can also run a query first, and then run the following command immediately after to retrieve the most recent query logs and filter for `"QueryMem"`:
```
$ grep 'tail -n 50 $(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO |
  grep -i "querymem"'

```

#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_step_by_step_query_memory_logging)Step by step query memory logging
This type of query memory logging may not appear for some queries due to the way GSQL handles querying internally. Specifically, it applies for queries run in GPR mode: `DISTRIBUTED` mode queries, queries run with `INTERPRET`, or when the session parameter `single_gpr` is set to `true`. Furthermore, it only appears at log levels `DEBUG` or `VERBOSE`.  
---  
The logs show memory usage by the query at different stages of its execution. The number at the end of each line indicates the number of bytes of memory utilized by the query.
The reported query memory usage is only a partial estimation of the query’s memory usage. When `STRING` and container type of local accumulators (ListAccum, MapAccum, ArrayAccum, HeapAccum, SetAccum, BagAccum) are used, the difference between the reported usage and the actual usage can differ greatly, as the memory tracker cannot accurately report the sizes of such types. The best way to evaluate the reported memory usage number is to compare the memory usage of different runs of the same query. If two runs of the same query report different numbers in terms of their memory usage, it is very likely that the query run reporting higher memory usage actually used more memory than the query run reporting lower memory usage.  
---  
For example, if we query for the memory usage for request ID `2.RESTPP_1_1.1665503463466.N` with the following command:
```
$ grun all 'grep -i 2.RESTPP_1_1.1665503463466.N $(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO | grep -i "querymem"'

We get the following response from two different nodes in a cluster:

These logs appear at `BRIEF` or higher logging levels.
Upon completion of a query, TigerGraph prints out a single log line summary about the request. This log line contains the query’s overall memory usage info and looks like the following:
```
Request|ldbc_snb::default,16973825.RESTPP_1_1.1676405639909.N,NNN,16,0,0,S|Finished in 259.595 ms|Response 98 bytes|Id conversion 0|mem watermark(MiB): 0

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_memory_state_thresholds)Memory state thresholds
GPE has memory protection to prevent out-of-memory issues. There are three memory states: 

Healthy
    
There is a healthy amount of free memory. All system operations run normally for best performance. 

Alert
    
There is a shortage of free memory. TigerGraph’s GPE system enables mechanisms to alleviate the memory pressure by moving some data onto disks and trying to use the maximum allowed threads for rebuilding. This starts to slow down the processing of new requests until the long-running queries finish and release memory. 

Critical
    
There is a critical shortage of free memory. TigerGraph’s GPE starts to abort queries to ensure system stability.
TigerGraph implements memory protection thresholds through the following environment variables. By default, the thresholds are only effective when a machine has more than 30 GB of total memory: 

`SysAlertFreePct`
    
The free memory threshold that causes TigerGraph to enter the Alert state. Default value is 30%. 

`SysMinFreePct`
    
The free memory threshold that causes TigerGraph to enter the Critical state. Default value is 10%.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_configure_memory_state_thresholds)Configure memory state thresholds
To configure these environment variables, run `gadmin config entry GPE.BasicConfig.Env`. This shows the current values of the environment variables and allows you to add new entries:
```
$ gadmin config entry GPE.BasicConfig.Env
✔ New: LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; CPUPROFILE=/tmp/tg_cpu_profiler; CPUPROFILESIGNAL=12; MALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_active:false▐
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Add your desired memory threshold configuration after the existing environment values. Use a semicolon `;` to separate the different environment variables:
```
✔ New: LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; CPUPROFILE=/tmp/tg_cpu_profiler; CPUPROFILESIGNAL=12; MALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_active:false;SysMinFreePct=5;SysAlertFreePct=25; **(1)**
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | This sets the critical threshold to 5 percent and the alert threshold to 25 percent.  
---|---  
Spaces have been added to the following full example for readability.
```
> gadmin config entry GPE.BasicConfig.Env
GPE.BasicConfig.Env [ LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; CPUPROFILE=/tmp/tg_cpu...(too long to show the full content, please use 'gadmin config get GPE.BasicConfig.Env' to get it) ]:

✔ New: LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; CPUPROFILE=/tmp/tg_cpu_profiler; CPUPROFILESIGNAL=12; MALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_active:false
; SysMinFreePct=20;SysAlertFreePct=30 **(1)**
bash![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | In this example, the user has set `SysMinFreePct` to `20`, meaning that queries will start aborting automatically for stability when 20% of system memory is free (80% utilization). The user has also set `SysAlertFreePct` to `30`, so queries will start being throttled at 30% free memory (70% utilization).  
---|---  
After making a change, run `gadmin config apply` to apply the changes and `gadmin restart gpe` to restart the GPE service. Changes will take effect after the restart.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_limit_query_memory_usage)Limit query memory usage
There are two ways to limit the memory usage of queries:
  * By system configuration. This affects all queries on your TigerGraph instance.
  * By HTTP request header. This affects one specific query run only and overrides the system configuration.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_by_system_configuration)By system configuration
You can set a limit of how much memory a query is allowed to use on any single node in a cluster. If a query’s memory usage exceeds this limit on any node in a cluster, the query is aborted automatically.
To set a limit for memory usage on any node for a cluster, use the `gadmin config` command to configure the value of the parameter `GPE.QueryLocalMemLimitMB`. For example, to set the limit to 100 MB, run the following command:
```
$ gadmin config set GPE.QueryLocalMemLimitMB 100
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

You must [restart the GPE service](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/manage-services#_start_stop_or_restart_a_service) for the change to take effect.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/system-management/memory-management#_by_http_header)By HTTP header
Another way to limit the query memory usage is to specify the memory limit at the time of the request through the HTTP header `GSQL-QueryLocalMemLimitMB` when using the [Run Query REST endpoint](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/built-in-endpoints#_run_an_installed_query_post). This applies to the specific request being run only, and overrides the system configuration.
For example, to set the limit to 100 MB, make the following request:
```
curl -X POST -H "GSQL-QueryLocalMemLimitMB: 100" -d '{"p":{"id":"Tom","type":"person"}}'
"http://localhost:9000/query/social/hello"
