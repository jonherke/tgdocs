The GSQL shell is a fully functional Java environment for interacting with the TigerGraph database. It is one of the primary ways to interact with the TigerGraph database and is included in a standard TigerGraph installation.
To learn more about the GSQL language, follow our tutorial series starting with [GSQL V3 Tutorial](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/master/demos/guru_scripts/docker/tutorial/4.x/README.md).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/#_launch_the_shell)Launch the shell
As the TigerGraph Linux user, type `gsql` into the bash terminal to start a GSQL shell session:
```
$ gsql
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

If authentication is enabled, you will need to provide credentials in order to launch the shell.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/#_change_scope)Change scope
In the GSQL shell, you can run commands on a global scope or on a local scope. When you start a GSQL session, you are in the global scope. To change to the local scope of a graph, run the `USE GRAPH` command.
```
GSQL > USE GRAPH social
Using graph 'social'
GSQL![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

To switch back to the global scope, run `USE GLOBAL`.
```
GSQL > USE GLOBAL
GSQL![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Operating on different scopes will require different privileges. For more information, see Roles and Privileges.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/#_multi_line_commands)Multi-line commands
By default, GSQL treats each line as one command; the GSQL interpreter will activate as soon as the end-df-line character is entered.
```
GSQL > ls **(1)**
---- Global vertices, edges, and all graphs
Vertex Types:
 - VERTEX Person(PRIMARY_ID id STRING, name STRING, score FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL) WITH STATS="OUTDEGREE_BY_EDGETYPE"
 - DIRECTED EDGE Friend(FROM Person, TO Person, weight FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL) WITH REVERSE_EDGE="Also_Friend"
 - DIRECTED EDGE Also_Friend(FROM Person, TO Person, weight FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL) WITH REVERSE_EDGE="Friend"
 - UNDIRECTED EDGE Coworker(FROM Person, TO Person, weight FLOAT, tag STRING, flag BOOL)
Graphs:
 - Graph social(Person:v, Friend:e, Also_Friend:e, Coworker:e)
Jobs:

**1** | GSQL executes a single-line command immediately after encountering the end-of-line character.  
---|---  
**2** | Trying to enter a multi-line command in the default single-line mode will cause an error.  
Multi-line mode allows the user to enter several lines of text without triggering immediate execution. This is useful when a statement is very long and the user would like to split it into multiple lines. It is also useful when defining a job or query, because they typically contain multiple statements.
To enter multi-line mode, use the command `BEGIN`. The end-of-line character is now disabled from triggering execution. The shell remains in multi-line mode until the command `END` or `ABORT` is entered. The `END` command triggers the execution of the multi-line block. Alternately, the `ABORT` command exits multi-line mode and discards the multi-line block.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/#_example)Example
In the example below, `BEGIN` and `END` are used to allow the SELECT statement to be split into several lines:
```
GSQL > BEGIN
GSQL > CREATE QUERY example () {
GSQL > PRINT "Hello world";
GSQL > }
GSQL > END
Successfully created queries: [example].

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/#_run_gsql_scripts_and_in_line_commands)Run GSQL scripts and in-line commands
You don’t always need to enter the interactive shell in order to run a GSQL command. You can also run command in-line or through a GSQL script.
To run a GSQL command non-interactively, run the bash command `gsql` followed by the GSQL commands you want to run in quotes:
```
$ gsql 'ls'
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

To run a GSQL script, put all your GSQL commands in a file (conventionally ending with the extension .gsql), and run:
```
$ gsql <filename>
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the script file.
You can also run a GSQL script from the GSQL shell. To do so, type in the file name prefixed with the `@` character:
```
GSQL > @<filename>
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the script file.
