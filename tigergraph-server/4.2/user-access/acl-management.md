Access Control Lists (ACLs) is deprecated as of Aug 2024 in v4.1.0. Please use fine-grained query privileges instead.   
---  
Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow you finer-grained control over access to queries. Using GSQL commands, you can change the owner of a query, grant ACL privileges on a query to a role, and view the ACL privileges on a user, a role, or a query.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_set_acl_password)Set ACL password
By default, users don’t have ACL passwords. They can choose to set an ACL password. Once a user’s ACL password is set, changing the ACL of queries owned by the user requires entering the user’s ACL password.

**1** | Putting the password in double quotes allow you to use special characters. You can enter a password without the double quotes, in which case you are only able to use alphanumerical characters.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_change_query_owner)Change query owner
With the ACL password of the current query owner, the owner themself or users with the `WRITE ROLE` privilege can change the owner of a query. If the current owner of the query doesn’t have an ACL password, then changing the owner does not require a password.
If a query does not have a current owner due to upgrades from an older version of TigerGraph, then anyone with the `WRITE_ROLE` privilege can run the command to change the query owner.
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_syntax_4)Syntax

  * `WRITE_ROLE` if the query is owned by another user


#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_procedure_4)Procedure
To change the owner of a query, run the following command and replace `owner_password` with the ACL password of the query owner.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_grant_acl_privilege_to_a_role)Grant ACL privilege to a role
The owner and **only** the owner of a query can grant ACL privileges on the query to specified roles. To grant an ACL privilege, the query owner must themselves have the corresponding RBAC privilege.
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_syntax_5)Syntax
```

```

**1** | If current ACL password is not supplied in the command, GSQL prompts the user for the ACL password if the query owner has an ACL password.  
---|---  
#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_required_privilege_5)Required privilege
  * `READ_QUERY` for granting `READ` privilege on the query.
  * `READ_DATA` for granting `EXECUTE` privilege on queries that do not update the graph.
  * `READ_DATA` and appropriate CRUD privileges for granting `EXECUTE` privilege on queries that create, update, or delete data of the graph.
    * For queries that update existing vertices and edges, the `UPDATE_DATA` privilege is needed.
    * For queries that delete vertices or edges, the `DELETE_DATA` privilege is needed.
    * For queries that create vertices or edges, the ACL privilege situation can be more complicated. See [Data CRUD privileges](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/access-control-model#_data_crud_privileges).


#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_procedure_5)Procedure
To grant `READ` privilege for a query `example_query` to a role `example_role`, run the following command. To grant `EXECUTE` privilege instead, replace `READ` with `EXECUTE`:
```
GSQL > GRANT ACL PRIVILEGE READ ON QUERY example_query TO example_role

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_revoke_acl_privilege_from_a_role)Revoke ACL privilege from a role
The owner of a query can revoke ACL privileges on the query from a role. If the ACL entry for a privilege (either `READ` or `EXECUTE`) becomes empty after removing specified roles, the [entry status](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/access-control-model#_acl_entry_status) for the privilege becomes `NOBODY`. When the ACL entry status for a privilege is `NOBODY`, no one, including the query owner, can access the query in the corresponding manner.
The effect of revoking ACL privileges from all roles in an entry by revoking from specified roles is different from [revoking ACL privileges from all using the keyword `ALL`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_revert_access_control_to_rbac).

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/acl-management#_revert_access_control_to_rbac)Revert access control to RBAC
