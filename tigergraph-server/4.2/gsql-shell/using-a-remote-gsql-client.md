## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_prerequisites)Prerequisites
  * The machine running the GSQL client needs to have Java 7.0 or later.
  * For a self-managed remote server, the server machine allows the client machine to access port 14240.
  * OpenSSL is needed on the client machine to get an SSL certificate from the TigerGraph Server or TigerGraph Cloud.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_connect_to_a_remote_server)Connect to a remote server
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_download_the_gsql_client)Download the GSQL client
[Download the GSQL client for a TigerGraph solution version directly from this page](https://dl.tigergraph.com).
As an alternative to downloading, you can also copy the file `gsql_client.jar` from an existing installation to the client machine. The client is packaged as a Java jar file, `gsql_client.jar` located in the folder `<TigerGraph_root_dir>/app/<VERSION_NUM>/dev/gdk/gsql/lib/` on an existing TigerGraph installation.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#obtain_ssl_cert_remote_server)Obtain SSL certificate
If you have SSL enabled, you must obtain the TigerGraph server’s public SSL certificate. Run the following Unix command, replacing `<ip_address>` with the IP address of your TigerGraph server, and replacing `<path_to_certificate>` with a filename for the certificate, such as `ssl_1.cert1`. Note that the port to access TigerGraph Server is 14240.
You need to install [`openssl`](https://www.openssl.org/) on your client machine to run this command.
```
echo | openssl s_client -connect <ip_address>:14240 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > <path_to_certificate>

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_connect_to_the_server)Connect to the server
To connect to a remote server, your must provide the following to the GSQL client:
  * The IP address of the GSQL server.
  * Your TigerGraph user credentials.
  * If you are running GSQL commands, the user you are logged in as must have the privileges to run them.
  * If SSL/TLS encryption (e.g., HTTPS) is enabled on the server, you must [provide the server’s SSL certificate](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#obtain_ssl_cert_remote_server).


Run the following command to connect to the remote server:
```
java -jar <path_to_client> \ **(1)**
 --cacert <path_to_certificate> \ **(2)**
 --ip <ip_address>:14240 \ **(3)**
 -u <username> **(4)**
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | Replace `<path_to_client>` with the file path to the GSQL client.  
---|---  
**2** | If you have the SSL certificate of the remote server, you can replace `<path_to_certificate>` with the path to your SSL certificate (most common). Otherwise, you can use `--ssl` instead to use the default certificate. Note that `--ssl` will be overridden by `--cacert` option. If the remote server doesn’t have SSL/TLS encryption enabled, you can omit these flags.  
**3** | Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address of your remote server. You can also [specify the IP address in a file and omit this flag](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_specify_server_ip_address_in_file).  
**4** | Replace `<username>` with the username of the TigerGraph user you want to be logged in as. If you don’t provide a `<username>`, the client uses the default user `tigergraph`.  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_specify_server_ip_address_in_file)Tip: Specify server IP address in file
You can create a one-line file called `gsql_server_ip_config` containing the IP address of the GSQL server. **This file needs to be in the same directory where you run GSQL.**
When there is a `gsql_server_up_config` file in the same directory where you run the GSQL client, the GSQL client uses the IP address stored in the file. You won’t need to specify the IP address in the command.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_tip_define_a_unix_alias_for_command_to_run_gsql_client)Tip: Define a Unix alias for command to run GSQL client
You can define a Unix alias to simplify the command to run the GSQL client:
```
alias gsql="java -jar <path_to_gsql_client>"
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

After defining the preceding alias, running `gsql` is equivalent to running `java -jar <path_to_gsql_client>`.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_connect_to_tigergraph_cloud_instance)Connect to TigerGraph Cloud instance
Since TigerGraph Cloud uses a different [authentication scheme](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users) from TigerGraph Server, the steps for using the GSQL client for a cloud solution are slightly different.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_download_the_gsql_client_2)Download the GSQL client
[Download the GSQL client for a TigerGraph solution version directly from this page](https://dl.tigergraph.com).
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_obtain_ssl_certificate)Obtain SSL certificate
Run the following Unix command, replacing `<domain>` with the domain of your Cloud solution and replace `<path_to_certificate>` with the local path to place the certificate file. Note that the port to access TigerGraph Cloud is 443.
Find the domain of a Cloud solution by clicking on it in the solution view under "My Solutions."
You need to install [`openssl`](https://www.openssl.org/) on your client machine to run this command.
```
echo | openssl s_client -connect <domain>:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > <path_to_certificate>

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_filepath_semantics)Filepath semantics
Data loading jobs always specify an input file location; logically the data should be on the server side, not on the client side. Because the command request comes from one machine and the target data file is on another machine, it no longer makes sense to use a relative path.
If a remote GSQL client invokes an instruction containing a relative path, the GSQL server considers the starting point of the path to be `<tigergraph_rootdir>/app/<VERSION_NUM>/dev/gdk/gsql` on the GSQL server. It is strongly recommended that GSQL commands use absolute paths only when run remotely.  
---  
For example, if the data file `cf_data.csv` is in the folder `/home/tigergraph/example/cf/`, then the command to run the loading job might look like the following:
```
java -jar gsql_client.jar 'RUN JOB load_cf USING FILENAME="/home/tigergraph/example/cf/cf_data.csv", SEPARATOR=",", EOL="\n"
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/gsql-shell/using-a-remote-gsql-client#_example_modifying_a_bash_script_for_a_remote_gsql_client)Example: Modifying a Bash script for a remote GSQL client
The GSQL Tutorials employ both GSQL and bash scripts to run the examples. Typically, each example case contains 3 GSQL command files (for schema creation, data loading, and querying) and one bash script to run all the parts together and to display status information. Below is a simplified version of the Collaborative Filtering (cf) bash script:
Bash script for Collaborative Filtering (cf) example
```
#!/bin/bash
test='cf'
###
gsql 'DROP ALL'
gsql ../${test}/${test}_model.gsql
gsql 'CREATE GRAPH gsql_demo(*)'

# Loading
gsql -g gsql_demo ../${test}/${test}_load.gsql
## loading script contains this line:
## RUN JOB load_cf USING FILENAME="../cf/data/cf_data.csv", SEPARATOR=",", EOL="\n"

# Querying
gsql -g gsql_demo ../${test}/${test}_query.gsql
gsql -g gsql_demo INSTALL QUERY ALL
gsql -g gsql_demo 'RUN QUERY topCoLiked("id1", 10)'
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

The bash script will not run from a remote GSQL client unless a few changes are made:
  * We need to invoke `java -jar gsql_client.jar` instead of `gsql`, and need to specify the server ip address.
  * If we use the `gsql_server_ip_config` file, this file must be in the same folder as the command file.


The GSQL Tutorial has several folders, one for each example, which suggests making several config files.
Below is an approach that minimizes the changes required and maximizes standardization.
  1. Do initial client setup. This is done only once.
    1. Store `gsql_client.jar` in a standard location. For example, `/home/tigergraph/gsql_client/ gsql_client.jar` )
    2. Create a file called `gsql_server_ip_config` containing the GSQL server’s IP address, and store it a standard location, say `~/gsql_client/gsql_server_ip_config`.
Sample config file:/home/tigergraph/gsql_client/gsql_server_ip_config
```
123.45.67.255
text![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

    3. In the .bashrc file in your home directory, add an alias for gsql which points to the standard location:
```
alias gsql='java -jar ~/gsql_client/gsql_client.jar'
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  2. Add a standard header to each bash script.
Standard which makes 'gsql' work on remote clients
```
alias gsql='java -jar gsql_client.jar'
shopt -s expand_aliases
ln -s ~/gsql_client/gsql_client.jar gsql_client.jar
ln -s ~/gsql_client/gsql_server_ip_config gsql_server_ip_config
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

This header does the following:
    1. Repeat the alias definition for the gsql command. The definition in `.bashrc` may not be visible here.
    2. By default, bash scripts ignore aliases. Instruct the script to use aliases.
    3. Define soft links from the current folder to the locations of the client jar and config file.
  3. Change any relative paths to absolute paths. This is the only step that must be customized for each script.
Here is the resulting script. Four standard lines were added to the beginning, and one line was edited in the `cf_load.gsql` file.


RUN_cf_remote.sh: Modified bash script for Collaborative Filtering (cf) example
```
#!/bin/bash
alias gsql='java -jar gsql_client.jar'
shopt -s expand_aliases
ln -s ~/gsql_client/gsql_client.jar gsql_client.jar
ln -s ~/gsql_client/gsql_server_ip_config gsql_server_ip_config
test='cf'
###
gsql 'DROP ALL'
gsql ../${test}/${test}_model.gsql
gsql 'CREATE GRAPH gsql_demo(*)'
# Loading
gsql -g gsql_demo ../${test}/${test}_load.gsql
## loading script contains this line:
## RUN JOB load_cf USING FILENAME="/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/document/examples/tutorial_real_life/cf/data/cf_load.csv", SEPARATOR=",", EOL="\n"
# Querying

gsql -g gsql_demo INSTALL QUERY ALL
