[Edit this Page](https://github.com/tigergraph/server-docs/edit/4.2/modules/backup-and-restore/pages/differential-backups.adoc)
# Differential Backup
As of version 4.2, the command
`gadmin backup create <tag> --incremental`
performs an [Incremental Backup](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/backup-and-restore/incremental-backup), not a differential backup. Differential backup is longer a direct feature, but it can be emulated by specifying the based to be the most recent full backup:
`gadmin backup create <tag> --incremental --base <recent_full_backup_tag>`
Differential backup files and incremental backup files use the same format; they merely differ in what time range of data they are instructed to store.
If you have differential backup files created with an earlier version, they can still be restored in versions 4.2+, if all other migration conditions are met. _ differential backup is actually the same as _Monday’s_.
