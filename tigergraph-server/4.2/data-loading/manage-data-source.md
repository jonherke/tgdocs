Loading jobs which using the Kafka Loader (from [cloud storage](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/load-from-cloud), [data warehouses](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/load-from-warehouse), or [external Kafka](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/load-from-kafka)) make use of _data sources_ , objects that you define and which become part of a graph’s catalog. Data sources are defined with a configuration file, which specify the configurations to apply to the data source.
This page describes the permissions required for different operations concerning data sources, as well as how to delete a data source.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/manage-data-source#_data_source_operation_permissions)Data source operation permissions
A data source can be either global or local:
  * A global data source can only be created by a user with `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege on the global scope, who can grant it to any graph.
  * A local data source belongs to a graph and cannot be accessed by other graphs.


The following are examples of permitted `DATA_SOURCE` operations.
  * Users with the `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege on the global scope may create a global level data source without assigning it to a particular graph:


```
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k1 = "/path/to/config"
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  * Users with the `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege on the global scope may grant/revoke a data source to/from one or more graphs:


```
GSQL > GRANT DATA_SOURCE k1 TO GRAPH graph1, graph2
GSQL > REVOKE DATA_SOURCE k1 FROM GRAPH graph1, graph2
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  * Users with the `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege for a particular graph user may create a local data source for that graph:


```
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k1 = "/path/to/config" FOR GRAPH test_graph
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

In the above statement, the local data_source k1 is only accessible to graph test_graph. A superuser cannot grant it to another graph.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/manage-data-source#_delete_a_data_source)Delete a data source
A data source variable can be dropped by a user who has sufficient privileges. A global data source can only be dropped by a users with global `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege. Users with `WRITE_DATASOURCE` privilege for one graph can drop data sources on that graph. The syntax for the `DROP DATA_SOURCE` command is as follows:
```
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE <source1>[<source2>...] | * | ALL
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Below are several examples of Kafka data source `CREATE` and `DROP` commands.
```
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k1 = "/home/tigergraph/kafka.conf"
GSQL > CREATE DATA_SOURCE k2 = "/home/tigergraph/kafka2.conf"
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE k1, k2
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE *
GSQL > DROP DATA_SOURCE ALL
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/data-loading/manage-data-source#_show_data_source)SHOW DATA_SOURCE
The `SHOW DATA_SOURCE` command will display a summary of all existing data sources for which the user has privilege:
```
GSQL > SHOW DATA_SOURCE *
// The sample output
Data Source:
 - KAFKA k1 ("127.0.0.1:9092")
The global data source will be shown in global scope. The graph scope will only show the data source it has access to.
