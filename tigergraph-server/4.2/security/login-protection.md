When you use your credentials to log in to TigerGraph, your account is automatically protected with the default login protection configurations:
  * After five consecutive failed login attempts, you must wait 10 seconds before attempting to log in again.
  * After five consecutive failed login attempts, you are prompted to change your password.
  * Any more failed attempts after the fifth consecutive failed attempts doubles the amount of time you must wait to attempt to log in again.


You can modify the relevant system configurations to modify the login protection.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/security/login-protection#_configure_the_number_of_failed_attempts_to_trigger_login_protection)Configure the number of failed attempts to trigger login protection
After a number of consecutive failed login attempts, GSQL disallows logins to the same account for a specified interval and prompts the owner of this account to change their password. The default number of consecutive failed attempts that triggers login protection is 5.
You can change this default configuration by using `gadmin config` commands to change the configuration `GSQL.LoginLimit.InitialThreshold`. For example, to change the number of failed attempts it takes to trigger login protection to three, run the following commands:
```
$ gadmin config set GSQL.LoginLimit.InitialThreshold 3
$ gadmin config apply
$ gadmin restart gsql

```

After running the commands, if a user has three **consecutive** failed attempts at login, they’ll have to wait for a specified period of time before attempting to log in again. When they log into their account, they are reminded to change their password.
Once the user successfully logs in, they no longer have to wait for the interval between logins.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/security/login-protection#_configure_the_amount_of_time_between_failed_attempts)Configure the amount of time between failed attempts
After a specified number of failed attempts, a user has to wait for a specified period of time before attempting to log in again. The default wait time is 10 seconds.
You can change this default configuration by using `gadmin config` commands to change the configuration `GSQL.LoginLimit.InitialWaitTimeSec`. For example, to change the time it takes for them to be able to attempt logins again to 20 seconds, run the following commands:
```
$ gadmin config set GSQL.LoginLimit.InitialWaitTimeSec 20
$ gadmin config apply
$ gadmin restart gsql

```

If more failed login attempts are recorded on the same account, the wait time doubles after a specified number of failed attempts. Once the user successfully logs in, they no longer have to wait for the interval between logins.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/security/login-protection#_configure_the_number_of_failed_attempts_to_double_wait_time)Configure the number of failed attempts to double wait time
If a user has already failed to log in enough times to trigger login protection, successive login failures cause the wait time to double. By default, every two failed attempts after login protection is triggered causes the wait time to double.
In other words, if a user has already failed five times, and has triggered the 10-second login protection period, two more failed attempts double the wait time to 20 seconds. Another two failed attempts double the wait time to 40 seconds, until they log in successfully.
You can change the number of consecutive failed attempts it takes for the wait time to double by changing the configuration `GSQL.LoginLimit.SecondaryThreshold`. For example, if you want every failed attempt to double the wait time after login protection has been triggered, run the following command:
```
$ gadmin config set GSQL.LoginLimit.SecondaryThreshold 1
$ gadmin config apply
$ gadmin restart gsql
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

If the user logs in successfully, the number of consecutive failed attempts is reset to 0, and the wait time is reset to 0 as well. The user will trigger login protection again if they have a sufficient number of failed login attempts.
