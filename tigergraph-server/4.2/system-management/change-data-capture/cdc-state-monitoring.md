Check the state of CDC Service with this command:
```
grun_p gpe "cat $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/cdc.yaml"
```

The response should look like this:
```
------------------ Output example for cdc.yaml on 1x2 cluster -------------------
### ---- (m1)_10.128.0.77 ---0--
tid: 3752092
safe_persistent_tid: 3752091
split_index: 0
index: 0
### ---- (m2)_10.128.0.84 ---1--
cat: /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/data/gstore/0/part/cdc.yaml: No such file or directory
```

If [CDC HA](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/system-management/change-data-capture/cdc-overview#_cdc_ha) is not enabled, the cdc state file should only exist on GPE Replica 1 node of each partition, such as `GPE_1#1` or `GPE_2#1`.
If [CDC HA](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/system-management/change-data-capture/cdc-overview#_cdc_ha) is enabled (the default setting in multi-replica clusters), the CDC state file may reside on any node with GPE servers. For each partition, only the state file on the GPE leader is active; state files on other nodes may be missing or outdated. You can determine this by checking the tid in the file or the file’s last update time.
Table 1. Information Fields for CDC Status Report: Field | Meaning  
---|---  
`tid` | The tid is the tid of the delta batch (largest tid) that was most recently written to external kafka. For a transaction, it’s the tid of the last delta batch for the transaction (must be COMMIT), which can be used to represent the transaction id.  
`safe_persistent_tid` | The `safe_persistent_tid` is the tid of the earliest delta batch among all open transactions that are not committed/rolled-back in CDC. If there’s no open transactions, this is the same as tid. All delta batches with tid `<safe_persistent_tid>` must have been written to external kafka.  
`split_index` | For non-transaction, it’s always 0. For transactions, the split_index is the index of the delta batch that was most recently written to external kafka among all delta batches for the same transaction.  
`index` | The index is an index of delta messages in a delta batch that was most recently written to external kafka.  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/system-management/change-data-capture/cdc-state-monitoring#_state_of_dim_service)State of DIM Service
DIM (Deleted Id Map) is an internal service designed to assist the CDC service in processing data updates that involve vertices already deleted from the database.
Command to check the state of DIM(Deleted Id Map) service
```
grun_p gpe "cat $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deleted_idmap_state.yaml"
```

Command to check disk usage of DIM(Deleted Id Map) service
```
grun_p gpe "du -sh $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deletedID_store"
```

The dim state file exists on all GPE nodes, unlike the cdc state file.
Example response for DIM state
```
------------ Output example for deleted_idmap_state.yaml on 1x2 cluster ------------
### ---- (m1)_10.128.0.77 ---0--
posted_delta_curr_tid: 3752092
posted_delta_next_split_index: 1
stored_deletedvid_curr_tid: 2275848
purged_deletedvid_curr_tid: 3752091
### ---- (m2)_10.128.0.84 ---0--

purged_deletedvid_curr_tid: 3752091
```

The purging task runs every 30 minutes by default.

Table 2. Information fields for DIM state report Field | Meaning  
---|---  
`posted_delta_curr_tid` | When reading a delta message with `tid=tid_origin` that contains a vertex deletion message, TigerGraph will collect `uid` for deleted vertex, then build a special vid-uid delta, and post back to deltaQ. The `posted_delta_curr_tid` is the most recently posted delta’s `tid_origin`.  
`posted_delta_next_split_index` | The `posted_delta_next_split_index` is the most recently posted delta’s `split_index` + 1. All `vertex-deletion` deltas with (`tid`, `split_index`) smaller than (`posted_delta_curr_tid`, `posted_delta_next_split_index`) will be handled by main delta handling process to generate an extra `deleted vid` delta into deltaQ.  
`stored_deletedvid_curr_tid` | When processing the special `vid-uid` delta for a deleted vertex, TigerGraph saves the `vid-uid` entry in the local RocksDB. The variable `stored_deletedvid_curr_tid` represents the `tid_origin` of the most recently stored delta, indicating it has been flushed to disk, not solely in memory. All `deleted vid` deltas with an origin `tid` smaller than this value (excluding it) have already been processed and stored in RocksDB. Note: The `idmap` is cached in memory, and if the map size is small (configured in `GPE.BasicConfig.Env` as `DIMCacheLimitInMB`, set at `30MB`), it is not flushed to disk. Consequently, this `tid` may lag behind in such cases.  
`purged_deletedvid_curr_tid` | Periodically, TigerGraph purges the entries in RocksDB based on the `safe_persistent_tid`. This is because the CDC already used some of the `vid-uid` entries and wrote to external Kafka, hence we don’t need these entries anymore.  
`purged_deletedvid_next_tid` | Purges `deleted vid` delta’s `tid_origin`. The `tid_orgin` represents the `tid` of origin delta that contains the vertex deletion message. All `deleted vid-uid` entries with `tid_orgin` smaller than this already have been purged from RocksDB. Configure this with `GPE.BasicConfig.Env: DIMPurgeIntervalInMin`), and update this `tid` if purging is actually performed.  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/system-management/change-data-capture/cdc-state-monitoring#_cdc_reset)CDC Reset
Please run the following steps to reset cdc.
  1. Stop related services
```
gadmin stop gpe -y
```

After a CDC reset, the previous data updates before `stop gpe` will be ignored by TigerGraph CDC. Only new data updates will be produced to external kafka.  
---  
  2. Clear state and data files for cdc
```
grun_p gpe "rm $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/files/cdc#*"
grun_p gpe "rm $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/cdc.yaml"
grun_p gpe "rm $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deleted_idmap_state.yaml"
grun_p gpe "rm -rf $(gadmin config get System.DataRoot)/gstore/0/part/deletedID_store"
```

  3. Start services
```
gadmin start all
```
