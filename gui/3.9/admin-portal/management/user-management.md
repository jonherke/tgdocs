The User Management page has three tabs: My Profile, All Users and Role Management.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_my_profile)My Profile
All users can access the My Profile tab to manage their own credentials.
![my profile updated](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/my-profile-updated.png)
To change your password, click the key icon ![key](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/key.png) in the Password card at the top.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_manage_secrets)Manage secrets
Below the cards, you can create and delete secrets, which are unique strings that can be used to generate authorization tokens. An alias is required for each secret.
You can create as many secrets for each graph as you want, but remember to copy the secret value and save it at a secure location when you generate a secret. Once you refresh the page or go to another page and come back, the actual secret value will be masked for security.
![secret management](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/secret-management.png)
With token authentication enabled, use the secrets to request tokens and add the tokens in the HTTP request headers to call TigerGraph REST endpoints. Read more at: [User Access Management](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_all_users)All Users
The All Users tab displays information on all users. Only users with user or proxy groups management permission can access this tab. Users with user management permissions (`READ_USER` and `WRITE_USER` privileges) can:
  * add new users
  * change passwords for other users
  * delete users


Users with proxy groups management permission (`READ_PROXYGROUP`, `WRITE_PROXYGROUP` privileges) can:
  * create proxy groups
  * change proxy rules
  * delete proxy groups


To see a list of all privileges, see [List of Privileges](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/reference/list-of-privileges).
![all users updated](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/all-users-updated.png)
Both native users and proxy users are displayed in the User section. However, you can only change the password for native users.  
---  
Click **+ Add User** to add new users:
![Add new user pop-up](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/all-users%20\(1\).png)
Click ![change others password btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/change-others-password-btn.png) to edit another user’s username and password.
Click ![delete btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/delete_btn.png) to delete a user.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_proxy_groups)Proxy groups
Proxy groups manage user access based on an aspect of their account identity set up as part of SSO or LDAP. For example, different proxy groups could correspond to different teams, and each team could be granted different access levels to different graphs.
Click the Proxy Group tab at the left under User to see all proxy groups:
![proxy groups](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/proxy-groups.png)
Click **+ Add Group** to add new proxy groups:
![add proxy group](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/add-proxy-group.png)
The attribute name and attribute value are checked against all attributes supplied by an identity provider (IDP) using SSO or LDAP. Please ensure the name and value match exactly with the IDP values.
Click ![edit](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/edit.png) to edit the proxy rule of an existing proxy group.
Click ![delete btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/delete_btn.png) to delete a proxy group.
Read more about proxy groups at [User Access Management](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_user_defined_roles)User-defined roles
The _User-defined roles_ tab lists all user-defined roles and allows users with sufficient privileges to create new roles. Users must have the `READ_ROLE` privilege on at least one graph to access this tab. This section describes the procedures to create, edit, and drop roles, as well as assign roles to users in TigerGraph. To learn more about roles and privileges in TigerGraph’s role-based access control system, see [User Access Management](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/).
To create/edit/delete a role, a user must also have the `WRITE_ROLE` privilege on that graph. See more details in [Access Control Model in TigerGraph](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/access-control-model).
All user-defined roles that you can view appear in a table:
![user defined roles](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/user-defined-roles.png)
Each row shows one role along with the privileges it contains. For global roles, all privileges on either global level or a specific graph will be listed.
Parent privileges overwrite child privileges. Similarly, global privileges overwrite local privileges.   
---  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_create_a_user_defined_role)Create a user-defined role
Click **+ Create role** at the right upper corner of the "User-defined Roles" tab to create a role. You can create a global role or a local role on a graph.
A global role can be granted privileges on any graph or globally. A local role is limited to one specific graph.
Select ![global ratio btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/global-ratio-btn.png) to start creating a global role. Choose global level privileges to assign to this role in the first panel. Clicking on a privilege grants that role immediately after the box is checked.
![grant privileges](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/grant-privileges.png)
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_local_privileges)Local privileges
Click **+ Grant privileges on another graph** at the bottom of the window to create privileges for a different graph.
When you grant local privileges, you have the ability to grant `READ_DATA`, `CREATE_DATA`, and `UPDATE_DATA` privileges at various levels:
  * Graph level: Grants access to all data on the graph.
  * Vertex or edge level: Grants access to all data on the specified vertices and edges, but not others.
  * Data level: Grants access to the specified attributes on the specified vertices and edges, but not other attributes on those or other vertices or edges.


Because of the granularity offered with this feature, the expanded window for some graphs is quite large. This example uses the ldbc_snb graph, which has too many vertex properties to see on one screen. Just the properties for one vertex type, Comment, are shown here.
![ldbc snb local permissions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/ldbc_snb-local-permissions.png)
Parent privileges override child privileges, so setting privileges for the graph automatically sets privileges for all vertex and edge types. Setting privileges for a vertex or edge type automatically sets privileges for all attributes.
The results can be filtered with the **Add a filter** button, which is useful for large and complex graphs. Enter text into this field to only return vertices and attributes that match the filter.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_edit_a_user_defined_role)Edit a user-defined role
Click ![edit](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/edit.png) to open the privileges menu again for editing. Deselect a privilege to drop it from the role and select one to add it to the role.
When editing a role, you cannot change a local role to a global role, or vice versa.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_drop_a_role)Drop a role
Click ![delete btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/_images/delete_btn.png) to drop a role.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.9/admin-portal/management/user-management#_role_management)Role management
In the _Role Management_ tab, users can view the role assignment of users, assign roles to users, and revoke roles from users. Users must have the `READ_ROLE` privilege along with the `READ_USER` or `READ_PROXYGROUP` privilege on at least one graph to access this tab.
Admin Portal does not indicate whether a user belongs a proxy group. You can find out more from the GSQL client. Admin Portal shows a combination of roles for proxy users. Proxy user which belongs to a proxy group inherits all the roles from the proxy group plus all the roles the proxy user has. Therefore, if you want to revoke a role from a proxy user, you need to revoke the role from the proxy group first. Then you might need to revoke the same role from the proxy user if the proxy user also has that role.

A user needs to have the `WRITE_ROLE` privilege to assign roles via Admin Portal. If you only have the `READ_ROLE` privilege, you can view the current assignment but cannot modify it.
