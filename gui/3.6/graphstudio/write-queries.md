On the Write Queries page, you can write and run custom queries with GSQL.
![write queries overview 3.3](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-overview_3.3.png)
The Write Query page is horizontally divided into two parts:
  * Query Editing Panel
  * Result, Log and Visualization Panel


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_query_editing_panel)Query Editing Panel
The Query Editing panel is divided into two sub-panels, one for select a query and the other for displaying the query for editing. The Query Editor features syntax highlighting customized for the GSQL language and also performs real-time semantic checking.
Above the query editing pane is a toolbar with the following buttons, from left to right:
![write queries toolbar 3.3](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-toolbar_3.3.png)
  * **Expand/Collapse** : Expand or collapse the Query Editing panel to or from full page mode. The icon changes depending on whether the panel is currently expanded or collapsed.
  * **Save** : Save the current query draft.
  * **Save as** : Save the current query as a new query under a new name.
  * **Install** : Install the query into the database.
  * **Run** : Run the query. If the query is not installed, it will run the query in interpreted mode. Note there is performance penalty to run queries in interpreted mode.
    * **Run Configuration:** Set the query runtime configurations.
  * **Delete** : Delete the selected query and its draft.
  * **Show query endpoint:** Show the RESTFul endpoint to execute the query. Only installed queries can see their RESTFul endpoints.
  * **Download:** Download the query as a gsql file.
  * **Discard query draft:** Delete the selected query draft.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_add_or_edit_query)Add Or Edit Query
To create a new query, simply click on the "New GSQL Query" button ![upload file btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/upload_file_btn.png) in the bottom-right corner of the left sub-panel, and type in the name of the new query in the popup window:
![create new query 3.6](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/create-new-query-3.6.png)
A query draft will be created with a template:
![write queries query draft 3.3](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-query-draft_3.3.png)
To edit an existing query, click on the query name in the list in the left panel.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_save_query_draft)Save Query Draft
Click the "save" button![save btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/save_btn.png)in the toolbar to save changes as a draft. This is separate from installing a query.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_save_as)Save as
Click the 'Save as' button to save the current query as a new query under a different name. After saving a query as another query, you will be redirected to the new query, and the original current will return to its last saved state.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_graph_data_science_library_queries)Graph Data Science Library Queries
GraphStudio is connected to the [Graph Data Science Library](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/intro/) and can import machine learning algorithms directly from a curated library. Click **Choose Query** on the Add New Query window to see the query choices. Select any queries that you would like to install. After installation, they will appear in the GSQL Queries window just like user-generated queries.
If you use the Data Science Library to install a query that is already installed, installation will fail.   
---  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_run_query_in_interpreted_mode)Run Query in Interpreted Mode
You can run a query in interpreted mode if you have saved it wihout errors. Click the run query button ![start loading button](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/start-loading-button.png). Together with the query execution result, a warning message will appear to notify user of the performance concerns running the query in interpreted mode. To speed up the query performance after you are satisfied with the GSQL query developed in interpreted mode, you can follow the instructions in the next section "Install Query".
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_install_query)Install Query
Saving a query enables the "install query" button ![publish btn](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/publish_btn.png). Click it to install the query, a process which will take about a minute.
![install query progress](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/install_query_progress.png)
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_run_query)Run Query
To run the query, click on the "run" button ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/run-installed-query.png) in the toolbar. If the query has no parameters, it will run directly and the result will be shown in the Result panel.
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-run-query-installed_3.3.png)
If the query requires parameters, the Enter Query Parameters panel will appear. Enter your parameter values and then click **Run query** at the bottom of the panel. You may need to scroll the panel to the bottom to find the Run Query button.
The query will be executed, and the results will be shown in the Result Panel.
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-run-install-query-with-param_3.3.png)
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_run_configuration)Run Configuration
You can set runtime configurations of the GSQL query by clicking the small ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/3.9.png) button to the right of the Run Query button, then a drop-down menu will appear with the **Run Configuration** button.
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-use-default-timeout_3.3.png)
This opens the Run Configuration panel, where you can set the GSQL query timeout. By default, it uses the timeout specified with gadmin server commands in the TigerGraph configuration.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_delete_query)Delete Query
Choose the query you want to delete and click on the "delete" button ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/delete_forever.png). The query will be deleted permanently.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_show_query_endpoint)Show Query Endpoint
After finishing writing the GSQL queries and installing the queries, you can access the queries via REST endpoints.
By clicking the "show query endpoint" button ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/endpoint.png) , you can see the format of the endpoint to access this query, so that you can integrate the query with your applications.
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/show_query_endpoint.png)
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_download)Download
You can download the selected query by clicking ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-toolbar-download-single-query_3.3.png) or download all your queries as a tar file by clicking ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-toolbar-download-all-queries_3.3.png)
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_delete_query_draft)Delete query draft
You can delete your query draft by clicking ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-toolbar-delete-query-draft_3.3.png) .
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_install_all_queries)Install All Queries
If you want to install all queries that you haven’t installed yet, click the "Install all queries" button ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/install_all_queries.png) in the GSQL Queries toolbar.
After some verification time, a pop up window listing all queries to be installed will show:
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/install_all_query_list.png)
Click the **INSTALL** button. Installation may take several minutes depending on the number of queries to install.

The Result panel shows the result of the last run query. Each query generates up to three types of result: visualized graph, JSON text, or log messages. On the left is a toolbar with buttons for changing the the panel size or for switching to a different type of result. The buttons, from top to bottom, are the following:
Menu option | Functionality  
---|---  
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/expand_panel.png) | Expand/Collapse: Expand or collapse the Result panel.  
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/schema-2.png) | View schema: Show the graph schema.  
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/visual-result.png) | Visualize graph result: Display query result in visualized graph.  
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/json-result.png) | View JSON result: Display query result in JSON format.  
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/table-result.png) | View table result: Display query result in a table.  
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/visualize_log.png) | View logs: Show the log for the most recent query run.

Viewing the graph schema makes it more convenient for developers to refer to the schema topology logic and easier to write correct GSQL queries.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_visualize_graph_result)Visualize graph result
If the query execution result contains a graph structure, the result will be visualized in this panel as a graph. The panel is the same as the [Explore Graph panel](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/explore-graph/graph-exploration-panel). The only difference is that each time you run a query, the previous result will be erased. In Explore Graph the results are added incrementally.

Switch to the JSON Result panel to see the result in JSON format.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_view_json_result)View JSON result
If there is no graph structure in the result, the result will be displayed in this panel as a JSON object.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_view_table_result)View table result
You can display the query result as a table:
![table view](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/table-view.png)
Table rows can be sorted by any column with primitive type values. You can also download the table as a CSV file by clicking the download button next to the table name.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_view_logs)View logs
If a query ran successfully, the Query Log will show a success message. If there was anything wrong when executing your query, such as invalid parameters or runtime errors, an error message will be shown in the Query Log panel:

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/write-queries#_expand_panels)Expand Panels
If you just want to focus on developing your query, or want to have more space to view your results, click the Expand button ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/expand_panel.png) in either the Query Editing panel or the Result panel.
If you expand the Query Editing panel, it looks like this:
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/write-queries-expand-query-editor-panel_3.3.png)
If you expand the Result panel, it looks like this:
![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/expanded-panel.png)
When the panel is expanded, the Expand button becomes the Collapse button ![image](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/3.6/graphstudio/_images/collapse_btn.png). Clicking it will return the display to the split panel view.
