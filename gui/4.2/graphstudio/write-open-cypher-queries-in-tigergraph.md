OpenCypher is a popular graph query language, and TigerGraph now supports the use of openCypher queries.
This allows users who are familiar with openCypher to query TigerGraph’s graph database in a more familiar way.
On this page, we will go through the steps of writing openCypher queries in both GraphStudio and GSQL Web Shell.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/graphstudio/write-open-cypher-queries-in-tigergraph#_writing_opencypher_queries_in_graphstudio)Writing openCypher Queries in GraphStudio
To write openCypher queries in GraphStudio, follow these steps:
  * Open GraphStudio and navigate to the "Write Queries" menu.


![openCypher writeQueriesMenu](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/graphstudio/_images/openCypher_writeQueriesMenu.png)
  * Click on the


![openCypher GreenPlusButton](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/graphstudio/_images/openCypher_GreenPlusButton.png)
and select "openCypher" as the query type, then click “Create”.
![openCypher AddQueryType](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/graphstudio/_images/openCypher_AddQueryType.png)
  * Write your openCypher query in the query editor.


```
CREATE DISTRIBUTED OPENCYPHER QUERY get_user_by_id() FOR GRAPH communication_mau {
MATCH (u:user)
WHERE u.id = "test"
Return u
}
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  * Click “Save query draft” and "Run query" to execute your query.
  * Click “Install Query” to install the openCypher query to the server
