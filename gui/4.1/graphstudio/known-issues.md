# Known Issues
### GraphStudio Metadata is not replicated using Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
In v3.2.0, GSQL implements metadata Cross-Region Replication (CRR). Currently, replication of metadata for GraphStudio on remote cluster is not supported. If you need to do that, use backup & restore as an alternative. However, GraphStudio can still be used on remote cluster.
### Solution import if STRING COMPRESS data type is disabled
In v3.1.0, objects related to STRING COMPRESS data type would be skipped during solution import. All the others would be imported successfully.
In v3.1.1, solutions containing the STRING COMPRESS data type would fail to import.
Please update the data type using STRING COMPRESS in your solution before importing into TG v3.1.0 and TG v3.1.1
### Solution import from version lower than v3.1 is not compatible with v3.1
Since TigerGraph supports HA for the application server in v3.1, GraphStudio and Admin Portal data storage has to be updated. The HA enhancement caused a known compatibility issue during solution import process from GraphStudio: a solution that is created from "Export Current Solution" from a version released prior to v3.1 cannot be imported into v3.1. A solution exported from v3.1 will work with v3.1 and can be imported through "Import An Existing Solution". Contact support@tigergraph.com for a detailed workaround if you want to import a solution tarball prior to TG3.1.
### After upgrading to v3.1, downgrading from HTTPS to HTTP (turn on/off SSL) will result in user authentication failure
In v3.1, TigerGraph enhanced the security configuration for cookie by setting a secure flag when SSL is enabled, which may trigger an issue when using Chrome to turn off SSL. Due to this security feature, when downgrading from HTTPS to HTTP, Chrome will not allow setting the same cookie. This will result in user authentication failure because the cookie fails to be set. To solve this problem, users can clear the cache from Chrome and refresh the browser. Enabling from HTTP to HTTPS will work as expected.
### After upgrading to v2.4, data mappings created in earlier versions of GraphStudio will disappear.
GraphStudio v2.4 changes internal loading job generation. Older version data mappings are deprecated. Please contact TigerGraph support if you need to migrate them from an earlier version.
### Integers larger than 2^53 - 1 may lose precision.
Read more at <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/307179/what-is-javascripts-highest-integer-value-that-a-number-can-go-to-without-losin>.
In the future, GraphStudio will use BigInt to solve this problem.
### Graph Exploration result disappears
Sometimes when you double-click a vertex, the graph exploration result disappears. This is only a front-end rendering issue. The data is still there. **Workaround** : click the change layout button ![screen shot 2021 07 22 at 9.56.00 am](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.1/graphstudio/_images/screen-shot-2021-07-22-at-9.56.00-am.png) , and choose any layout. Everything will be rendered.
### Edge response area is too big
When there are edges very close to one another, their click response areas may overlap, making it hard to select the edge you want. This happens after zoom-in / zoom-out or connecting to another screen sometimes. **Workaround** : click a blank place in the working panel then zoom-in and zoom-out. The response area will back to normal.
### You cannot use fixed binary type attributes
Currently GraphStudio doesn’t support fixed binary type attributes in the schema. If you create your graph schema from GSQL with such attributes, GraphStudio will refuse to work. We will support this feature in future releases.
### Loading jobs created from GSQL won’t be shown
GraphStudio can only recognize data mapping procedures created through GUI. If you create loading jobs from GSQL, they won’t be shown in GraphStudio.
### GSQL changes do not auto refresh
If you make changes to graph schema, and create/delete/modify global schema and local schema through GSQL, you need to refresh the browser for the changes to show up in GraphStudio.
### Config expression with accumulators will be not applicable with refresh button
On Explore Graph, Build Graph Pattern and Write Query pages, a refresh button ![refresh button](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.1/graphstudio/_images/refresh-button.png) to retrieve updated data is used in the visualization viewer. If your color/size configs use an accumulator as a variable, it will be lost in the new visualization after clicking the refresh button.
### Report bugs to us
If you find any bugs, please report them to support@tigergraph.com.We really appreciate it!
