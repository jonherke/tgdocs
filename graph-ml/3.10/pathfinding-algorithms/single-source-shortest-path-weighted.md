Algorithm link: [Single-source Shortest Path (Weighted)](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Path/shortest_path/weighted)
Updated 15 Oct 2024 to document the overlooked `epsilon` parameter.   
---  
Finding shortest paths in a graph with weighted edges is algorithmically harder than in an unweighted graph because even after you find one path to a vertex T, you cannot be certain that it is a shortest path.
If edge weights are always positive, then you must keep trying until you have considered every in-edge to T. If edge weights can be negative, then it’s even harder. You must consider all possible paths.
A classic application for a weighted shortest path algorithm is finding the shortest travel route to get from an origin location to a destination location. In this case, the edge weights would be the distances between vertices. In general, any application where you are looking for the cheapest route is a possible fit.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/single-source-shortest-path-weighted#_notes)Notes
If you have edges with positive weights, use `shortest_path_pos_wt`, which is based on the delta-stepping approach, to take advantage of TigerGraph’s parallel processing. Each round, the algorithm tries to find a shorter path to each destination. `epsilon` (aka `delta`) is the minimum path reduction the algorithm must find in a round in order to justify searching for another round. The well-known Dijsktra’s algorithm is not well-suited for parallel computation.
If you have edges with both positive and negative weights, use `shortest_path_any_wt`, which implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm. If there is more than one path with the same total weight, the algorithm returns one of them.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/single-source-shortest-path-weighted#_specifications)Specifications
The shortest path algorithm can be optimized if we know all the weights are non-negative. If there can be negative weights, then sometimes a longer path will have a lower cumulative weight. Therefore, we have two versions of this algorithm

**Parameter** | Description | Default  
---|---|---  
`VERTEX source` | The source vertex to start from. Provide the vertex ID and type as a tuple: `("id","type")` | (empty string)  
`SET<STRING> v_type_set` | Names of vertex types to use | (empty string)  
`SET<STRING> e_type_set` | Names of edge types to use | N/A  
`STRING weight_attribute` | Name of the edge weight attribute | (empty string)  
`STRING weight_type` | The data type of the edge weight attribute. Can be `INT`, `FLOAT`, or `DOUBLE`. | (empty string)  
`FLOAT epsilon` | Minimum delta weight. | 0.001  
`INT print_limit` | If >=0, max number of vertices to output to JSON | -1  
`BOOL print_results` | Whether to print results in JSON format to standard output | True  
`STRING result_attribute` | If not empty, store distance values in INT to this vertex attribute | (empty string)  
`STRING file_path` | If not empty, write output to this file. | (empty string)  
`BOOL display_edges` | If true, include the graph’s edges in the JSON output, so that the full graph can be displayed in the query view window on GraphStudio. | False  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/single-source-shortest-path-weighted#_output)Output
Computes a shortest distance (given in `INT` format) and a shortest path (`STRING`) from a given _source_ vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
Returns a result size of V, the number of vertices in the graph.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/single-source-shortest-path-weighted#_time_complexity)Time complexity
For a graph with positive weight edges, the time complexity is approximately O(V+E), where V is equal to the number of vertices and E is equal to the number of edges.
For a graph with positive and negative weight edges, the time complexity is O(V⋅E).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/single-source-shortest-path-weighted#_example)Example
The graph below has only positive edge weights. Using vertex A as the source vertex, the algorithm discovers that the shortest weighted path from A to B is A-D-B, with distance 8. The shortest weighted path from A to C is A-D-B-C with distance 9.

The graph below has both positive and negative edge weights. Using vertex A as the source vertex, the algorithm discovers that the shortest weighted path from A to E is A-D-C-B-E, with a cumulative score of 7 - 3 - 2 - 4 = -2.
