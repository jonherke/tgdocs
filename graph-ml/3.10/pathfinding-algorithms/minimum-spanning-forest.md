Algorithm link: [Minimum Spanning Forest](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Path/minimum_spanning_forest)
Given an undirected graph with one or more connected components, a minimum spanning forest is a set of minimum spanning trees, one for each component.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-forest#_notes)Notes
This is an implementation of the algorithm in section 6.2 of Qin et al. 2014: [Scalable Big Graph Processing in MapReduce](http://www-std1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~hcheng/paper/SIGMOD2014qin.pdf)

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-forest#_parameters)Parameters
**Parameter** | Description | Default  
---|---|---  
`SET<STRING> v_type` | Names of vertex types to use | (empty set of strings)  
`SET<STRING> e_type` | Names of edge types to use | (empty set of strings)  
`STRING weight_attribute` | Name of edge weight attribute | (empty string)  
`STRING weight_type` | Data type of edge weight attribute (must be `INT`, `FLOAT`, or `DOUBLE`) | (empty string)  
`BOOL print_results` | If True, output JSON to standard output | True  
`STRING result_attribute` | If not empty, store result values (`BOOL`) to this attribute | (empty string)  
`STRING file_path` | If not empty, write output to this file. | (empty string)  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-forest#_output)Output
Computes a minimum spanning forest. If the JSON or file output selected, the output is the set of edges that form the MSF. If the result_attribute option is selected, the edges which are part of the MSF are tagged True; other edges are tagged False.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-forest#_result_size)Result size
V-c where V is the number of vertices and c is the number of components.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-forest#_time_complexity)Time complexity
This algorithm has a time complexity of O((V+E)⋅log(V)), where V is equal to the number of vertices and E is equal to the number of edges.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-forest#_example)Example
Refer to the example for the [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/pathfinding-algorithms/minimum-spanning-tree) algorithm. This graph has three components. The MSF algorithm finds an MST for each of the three components.
