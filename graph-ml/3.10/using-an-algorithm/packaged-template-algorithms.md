Beginning with TigerGraph Server 3.8, you can use packaged queries to run most Graph Data Science Library algorithms.
Packaged template queries are a simplified method for working with algorithms (or other GSQL queries) that are preinstalled in a TigerGraph instance. They use the keyword `CALL` to run with just-in-time compilation for improved performance.
Packaged queries cannot be run from GraphStudio.   
---  
The syntax is very similar to using a package in Python.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/using-an-algorithm/packaged-template-algorithms#_import_and_explore_template_queries)Import and explore template queries
In TigerGraph version 3.8.0 and later, run the following command to import the query package.
```
GSQL > IMPORT PACKAGE GDBMS_ALGO
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Wait a few moments for the queries to load. Run `SHOW PACKAGE` to check that installation was successful.
```
GSQL > SHOW PACKAGE
Packages on global:
 - GDBMS_ALGO
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Run `SHOW PACKAGE` again, this time specifying `GDBMS_ALGO`, to see the list of sub-packages. Each sub-package corresponds to a category of GDS algorithms.
```
GSQL > SHOW PACKAGE GDBMS_ALGO
Packages GDBMS_ALGO:
 - Sub-Packages:
  - centrality
  - classification
  - community
  - graphML
  - path
  - similarity
  - topological_link_prediction
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

By specifying a sub-package in the `IMPORT PACKAGE` command, you can choose to import only a subset of the package. The following command imports only the `community` sub-package.
```
GSQL > IMPORT PACKAGE GDBMS_ALGO.community
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Use dot notation to explore each sub-package.
```
GSQL > SHOW PACKAGE GDBMS_ALGO.centrality
Packages GDBMS_ALGO.centrality:
 - Object:
   - Packaged Queries:
    - article_rank(string v_type, string e_type, float max_change, int maximum_iteration, float damping, int top_k, bool print_results, string result_attribute, string file_path)
    - betweenness_cent(set<string> v_type_set, set<string> e_type_set, string reverse_e_type, int max_hops, int top_k, bool print_results, string result_attribute, string file_path, bool display_edges)
...
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

The `SHOW` command (and the pattern matching found in [the SHOW command documentation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/3.9/ddl-and-loading/defining-a-graph-schema#show—​view-parts-of-the-catalog)) works with template queries as well.
```
SHOW TEMPLATE QUERY -r "GDBMS_ALGO.community.tri.*"
```

matches all Community template queries starting with the string `tri`.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/using-an-algorithm/packaged-template-algorithms#_run_a_packaged_query)Run a packaged query
To run (or `call`) a packaged query, you must first be using a graph. Run the GSQL command `USE GRAPH <graph name>` first.
Use the `CALL` command with a specific query name from a package and include the parameters.
```
GSQL > USE GRAPH ldbc_snb
Using graph `ldbc_snb`
GSQL > CALL GDBMS_ALGO.community.louvain(["Person"],["KNOWS"],"weight",10,"","",true)
gsql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

In this example, we call the [Louvain](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/louvain) algorithm, specifying:
  * A set of strings `["Person"]` as the vertex types to use
  * A set of strings `["KNOWS"]` as the edge types to traverse
  * A string `"weight"` as the edge weight attribute
  * An integer `10` as the maximum limit of iterations
  * An empty string `""` for the result attribute, ensuring nothing will be written to any vertices
  * An empty string `""` for the file path, ensuring the results will not be written as a file
  * A boolean `true` to print the results to the console in JSON format.


The **first** time you call an algorithm on a particular graph and with a particular set of graph schema elements (vertex types, edge types, and/or vertex or edge attributes), it goes through a short just-in-time-compilation process to optimize the execution plan for the query.
If you run the same algorithm with the same graph schema elements (regardless of modification to other non-schema parameters such as number of iterations), it does not require compilation and immediately runs the algorithm query.
Therefore, in the previous example, changing any of the first three parameters requires recompilation, but changing any of the other parameters runs the query without needing compilation.
On the `ldbc_snb` graph, the results look like this after the query runs:
```
------Running query------
{
 "error": false,
 "message": "",
 "version": {
  "schema": 0,
  "edition": "enterprise",
  "api": "v2"
 },
 "results": [
  {"AllVertexCount": 9163},
  {"InitChangeCount": 0},
  {"VertexFollowedToCommunity": 355},
  {"VertexFollowedToVertex": 0},
  {"VertexAssignedToItself": 729},
  {"FinalCommunityCount": 9537}
 ]
}
