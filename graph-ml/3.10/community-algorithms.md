# Community Algorithms
Algorithm links: [Community Algorithms](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Community)
Community algorithms group together vertices or edges that satisfy some rule for being connected to one another. Community algorithms are different from [classification](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/classification-algorithms/) algorithms because classification does not necessarily consider connections.
The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following community algorithms:
  * [Weakly Connected Components](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/connected-components)
    * [WCC (Small-World Optimized)](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/wcc-small-world)
  * [k-Core Decomposition](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/k-core-decomposition)
  * [Label Propagation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/label-propagation)
  * [Speaker-Listener Label Propagation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/slpa)
  * [Local Clustering Coefficient](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/local-clustering-coefficient)
  * [Louvain](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/louvain)
  * [Strongly Connected Components](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/community-algorithms/strongly-connected-components)
