Algorithm link: [Jaccard Similarity of Neighborhoods (Batch)](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Similarity/jaccard/all_pairs)
This algorithm computes the same similarity scores as the [Jaccard similarity of neighborhoods, single source](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/similarity-algorithms/jaccard-similarity-of-neighborhoods-single-source).
Instead of selecting a single source vertex, however, it calculates similarity scores for all vertex pairs in the graph in parallel.
Since this is a memory-intensive operation, it is split into batches to reduce peak memory usage. The user can specify how many batches it is to be split into.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/similarity-algorithms/jaccard-similarity-of-neighborhoods-batch#_parameters)Parameters
Name | Description  
---|---  
`top_k` | Number of top scores to report for each vertex  
`v_type` | Vertex type to calculate similarity for  
`feat_v_type` | Feature vertex type  
`e_type` | Directed edge type to traverse  
`reverse_e_type` | Reverse edge type to traverse  
`similarity_edge` | If provided, the similarity scores will be saved to this edge type  
`src_batch_num` | Number of batches to split the source vertices into  
`nbor_batch_num` | Number of batches to split the 2-hop neighbor vertices into  
`print_results` | If `true`, output JSON to standard output.  
`print_limit` | Number of source vertices to print, -1 to print all  
`file_path` | If a file path is provided, the algorithm will output to a file specified by the file path in CSV format  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/similarity-algorithms/jaccard-similarity-of-neighborhoods-batch#_time_complexity)Time complexity
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(E), where E is the number of edges.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/similarity-algorithms/jaccard-similarity-of-neighborhoods-batch#_output)Output
The result contains the top _k_ Jaccard **similarity** scores for each vertex and its corresponding pair. A pair is only included if its similarity is greater than 0, meaning there is at least one common neighbor between the pair. The result is available in JSON format, or can be output to a file in CSV, or it can be saved as an edge on the graph itself. A JSON formatted result could look like this:
