Algorithm: [Weighted Degree Centrality](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/Centrality/degree/weighted/tg_weighted_degree_cent.gsql)
Degree centrality is defined as the number of edges connected to a vertex. The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a vertex for catching whatever is flowing through the network.
Weighted degree centrality allows you to assign weights to the edges connected to a vertex.

Parameter | Description  
---|---  
`STRING v_type` | Vertex type to traverse.  
`STRING e_type` | Edge type to traverse.  
`STRING reverse_e_type` | Reverse vertex type to traverse and calculate in-degree.  
`STRING weight_attribute` | The name of the attribute that indicates the weight of the edge. The attribute itself must be of type `INT`.  
`BOOL in_degree` | Whether to count incoming edges when calculating degree centrality.  
`BOOL out_degree` | Whether to count outgoing edges when calculating degree centrality.  
`INT top_k` | The number of vertices with the highest degree centrality to return.  
`BOOL print_results` | If true, return JSON results to standard output.  
`STRING result_attribute` | If not empty, save the degree centrality of each vertex to this attribute.  
`STRING file_path` | If not empty, output CSV results to this filepath.  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/weighted-degree-centrality#_output)Output
The vertices with the highest degree centrality scores along with their scores.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/weighted-degree-centrality#_time_complexity)Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(E), where E is the total number of edges in the graph.
