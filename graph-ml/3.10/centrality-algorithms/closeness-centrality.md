Algorithm link: [Closeness Centrality](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Centrality/closeness)
We all have an intuitive understanding when we say a home, an office, or a store is "centrally located." Something that is centrally located is roughly equidistant from several destinations.
Closeness Centrality provides a precise measure of how "centrally located" all the vertices are. The steps below show the steps for one vertex `v`:
Step | Mathematical Formula  
---|---  
1. Compute the average distance from vertex v to every other vertex: | davg(v)=∑u≠vdist(v,u)/(n−1)  
2. Invert the average distance, so we have average closeness of v: | CC(v)=1/davg(v)  
This is repeated across all vertices in the graph.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/closeness-centrality#_notes)Notes
  1. The `reverse_e_type` (reverse edge type) parameter is always required. For undirected edges, use the same value for both `e_type` and `reverse_e_type`.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/closeness-centrality#_references)References
TigerGraph’s closeness centrality algorithm uses multi-source breadth-first search (MS-BFS) to traverse the graph and calculate the sum of a vertex’s distance to every other vertex in the graph, which vastly improves the performance of the algorithm.
The algorithm’s implementation of MS-BFS is based on the paper [The More the Merrier: Efficient Multi-source Graph Traversal by Then et al](https://db.in.tum.de/~kaufmann/papers/msbfs.pdf).

Computes a Closeness Centrality value (FLOAT type) for each vertex, calculated from the average distance between that vertex and every other vertex.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/closeness-centrality#_result_size)Result size
V, or the number of vertices. One FLOAT value is returned for each vertex.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/closeness-centrality#_time_complexity)Time complexity
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(E∗V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/closeness-centrality#_example)Example
Closeness centrality can be measured for either directed edges (from `v` to others) or for undirected edges. Directed graphs may seem less intuitive, however, because if the distance from Alex to Bob is 1, it does not mean the distance from Bob to Alex is also 1.
For our example, we wanted to use the topology of a friendship graph, but to have undirected edges. We emulated an undirected graph by using both `Friend` and `Also_Friend` (reverse-direction) edges.
```
# Use _ for default values
RUN QUERY tg_closeness_cent(["Person"], ["Friend", "Also_Friend"], _, _,
_, _, _, _, _)
