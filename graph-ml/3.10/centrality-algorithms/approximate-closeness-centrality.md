Algorithm link: [Approximate Closeness Centrality](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Centrality/closeness/approximate)
In the [Closeness Centrality algorithm](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/closeness-centrality), to obtain the closeness centrality score for a vertex, we measure the distance from the source vertex to every single vertex in the graph.
In large graphs, running this calculation for every vertex can be highly time-consuming.
This algorithm approximates the closeness centrality score for each vertex pair by combining two estimation approaches: sampling and pivoting. This hybrid estimation approach offers near-linear time processing and linear space overhead within a small relative error.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/approximate-closeness-centrality#_notes)Notes
This query uses another subquery [`closeness_cent_approx_sub`](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/schema-free/closeness_cent_approx_sub.gsql), which needs to be installed before `closeness_approx` can be successfully run.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/approximate-closeness-centrality#_references)References
For further information about the algorithm design, see [Cohen et al., 2013, Computing Classic Closeness Centrality, at Scale.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0035.pdf)

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/approximate-closeness-centrality#_parameters)Parameters
Name | Description  
---|---  
`SET<STRING> v_type_set` | Vertex types to calculate approximate closeness centrality for.  
`SET<STRING> e_type_set` | Edge types to traverse.  
`INT k` | Size of the sample.  
`INT max_hops` | Upper limit of how many jumps the algorithm will perform from each vertex.  
`DOUBLE epsilon` | The maximum relative error, between 0 and 1. Setting a lower value produces a more accurate estimate but increases run time.  
`BOOL print_results` | Whether to print the output to console in JSON format.  
`STRING file_path` | If provided, the algorithm will output to this file path in CSV format  
`INT debug` | There are many conditional logging statements inside the query. If the input is 0, nothing will be logged. If the input is 1, everything else but the breadth-first-search process from the sample-node will be logged. If the input is 2, everything will be logged.  
`INT sample_index` | The algorithm will partition the graph based on the sample size. This index indicates which partition to use when estimating closeness centrality.  
`INT maxsize` | If the number of vertices in the graph is lower than `maxsize`, the exact closeness centrality is calculated instead and nothing will be approximated.  
`BOOL wf` | Whether to use the [Wasserman and Faust](https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_Network_Analysis.html?id=CAm2DpIqRUIC) formula to calculate closeness centrality rather than the classic formula.  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/approximate-closeness-centrality#_output)Output
The result is a list of all vertices in the graph with their approximate closeness centrality score. It is available both in JSON and CSV format.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/approximate-closeness-centrality#_example)Example
Below is an example of running the algorithm on the social10 test graph and an excerpt of the response.
