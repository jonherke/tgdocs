Algorithm links: [Influence Maximization](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Centrality/influence_maximization)
Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small subset of vertices in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence. There are two versions of the Influence Maximization algorithm. Both versions find k vertices that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network. The CELF version improves upon the efficiency of the greedy version and should be preferred in analyzing large networks.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/influence-maximization#_notes)Notes
The algorithm is implemented based on the following research papers:
  * CELF: [Cost-effective Outbreak Detection in Networks](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/detect-kdd07.pdf)
  * Greedy: [Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd03-inf.pdf)

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/influence-maximization#_parameters)Parameters
The CELF version and the greedy version of the algorithms share the same set of parameters.
Name | Description  
---|---  
`STRING v_type` | The vertex type to measure influence of  
`STRING e_type` | The edge type to traverse  
`STRING weight_attribute` | The name of the weight attribute on the edge type  
`INT top_k` | The number of vertices with the highest influence score to return  
`BOOL print_results` | If true, print results to JSON output.  
`STRING file_path` | If not empty, save results in CSV to this file.  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/influence-maximization#_output)Output
Returns the ID of the vertices with the highest influence scores along with their scores.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/influence-maximization#_time_complexity)Time complexity
The greedy version has a complexity of O(E∗k), where E is the number of edges and k is the number of top scores to report.
The CELF version also has a worst-case complexity of O(E∗k), but generally performs much better with a best-case complexity of O(E).
