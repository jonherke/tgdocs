Algorithm link: [Article Rank](https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Centrality/article_rank)
ArticleRank is an algorithm that has been derived from the PageRank algorithm to measure the influence of journal articles.
Page Rank assumes that relationships originating from low-degree vertices have a higher influence than relationships from high-degree vertices. Article Rank keeps the PageRank methodology but modifies the formula to lower the influence of low-degree nodes.
The Article Rank of a node v at iteration i is defined as:
ArticleRanki(v)=(1−d)+d∑w∈Nin(v)ArticleRanki−1(w)|Nout(w)|+¯Nout
Within the formula:
  * Nin(v) are the incoming neighbors and Nout(v) are the outgoing neighbors of node v.
  * d is a damping factor in [0, 1], usually set to 0.85.
  * ¯Nout is the average outdegree.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/article-rank#_parameters)Parameters
Name | Description  
---|---  
`STRING v_type` | A vertex type.  
`STRING e_type` | An edge type.  
`FLOAT max_change` | Article Rank will stop iterating when the largest difference between any vertex’s current score and its previous score ≤ `max_change.` That is, the scores have become very stable and are changing by less than `max_change` from one iteration to the next.  
`INT maximum_iteration` | Maximum number of iterations.  
`FLOAT damping` | The damping factor. Usually set to 0.85.  
`INT top_k` | The number of results with the highest scores to return.  
`BOOL print_results` | If true, print JSON output.  
`STRING result_attribute` | If not empty, store the article rank score of each vertex in this attribute.  
`STRING file_path` | If not empty, write output to this file.  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/article-rank#_output)Output
Returns the article rank score for each vertex in descending order.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/article-rank#_result_size)Result size
The result size is equal to V, the number of vertices, because one score is produced for every vertex in the graph.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/centrality-algorithms/article-rank#_time_complexity)Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(E∗k), where E is the number of edges and k is the number of iterations.
The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum. Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

Suppose we have the following graph:

By running Article Rank on the graph, we will see that the vertex with the highest score is Dan:
