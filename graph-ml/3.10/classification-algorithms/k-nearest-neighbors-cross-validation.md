k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is often used for machine learning. You can choose the value for `topK` based on your experience, or using cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameters.
In our library, Leave-one-out cross-validation for selecting optimal _k_ is provided. Given a _k_ value, we run the algorithm repeatedly using every vertex with a known label as the source vertex and predict its label. We assess the accuracy of the predictions for each value of _k_ , and then repeat for different values of k in the given range.
The goal is to find the value of k with highest predicting accuracy in the given range, for that dataset.
