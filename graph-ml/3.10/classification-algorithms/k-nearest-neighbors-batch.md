This algorithm is a batch version of the [k-Nearest Neighbors, Cosine Neighbor Similarity, single vertex](https://app.gitbook.com/@tigergraph/s/document/~/edit/drafts/-Ll49vrTnAN15ff3rsHW/v/2.5/graph-algorithm-library#k-nearest-neighbors-cosine-neighbor-similarity-single-vertex). It makes a prediction for every vertex whose label is not known (i.e., the attribute for the known label is empty), based on its k nearest neighbors' labels.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/classification-algorithms/k-nearest-neighbors-batch#_parameters)Parameters
Parameter | Description | Default Value  
---|---|---  
`SET<STRING> v_type_set` | The vertex types to calculate the distance for. | (empty set of strings)  
`SET<STRING> e_type_set` | The edge types to use | (empty set of strings)  
`SET<STRING> reverse_e_type_set` | The reverse edge types to use | (empty set of strings)  
`STRING weight_attribute` | If not empty, use this edge attribute as the edge weight. | (empty string)  
`STRING label` | If not empty, read an existing label from this attribute. | (empty string)  
`INT top_k` | The number of nearest neighbors to consider | N/A  
`BOOL print_results` | If true, print output in JSON format to the standard output. | True  
`STRING filepath` | If not empty, write output to this file. | (empty string)  
`STRING attr` | If not empty, store the predicted label to this vertex attribute. | (empty string)  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/classification-algorithms/k-nearest-neighbors-batch#_output)Output
Returns the predicted label for the vertices whose label attribute is empty.
The result is available in three forms:
  * streamed out in JSON format
  * written to a file in tabular format, or
  * stored as a vertex attribute value.


The result size is equal to V, the number of vertices in the graph.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/classification-algorithms/k-nearest-neighbors-batch#_time_complexity)Time complexity
This algorithm has a complexity of O(E2V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graph-ml/3.10/classification-algorithms/k-nearest-neighbors-batch#_example)Example
For the movie graph shown in the single vertex version, run knn_cosine_all, using topK=3. Then you get the following result:
```

  "Source": [
   {
    "v_id": "Jing",
    "v_type": "Person",
    "attributes": {
     "name": "Jing",

     "predicted_label": "",
     "@predicted_label": "a"
    }
   },
   {
    "v_id": "Neil",
    "v_type": "Person",
    "attributes": {
     "name": "Neil",

  ]
 }
