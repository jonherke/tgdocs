This page walks you through running the TigerGraph ML Workbench in a Docker container.
To help you get started quickly, we provide a “sandbox” Docker image that has the TigerGraph database and ML Workbench pre-installed. The [“Cora” dataset](https://graphsandnetworks.com/the-cora-dataset/) and the [IMDB datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) used for tutorials are also preloaded into the database.
Use this link to download Docker if needed: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-prem/sandbox#_prerequisites)1. Prerequisites
  * You machine meets the [Hardware and Software Requirements](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/installation/hw-and-sw-requirements).
    * Make sure you are allocating enough CPU and memory to your Docker containers. TigerGraph recommends allocating at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB of memory.
  * Docker Desktop is running on your machine.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-prem/sandbox#_procedure)2. Procedure
  1. Run the following command to pull the Workbench image, bind ports, map a shared data folder, and start a container from the image
```
docker run -it -p 14022:22 -p 8888:8888 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 -p 6006:6006 --name tgsandbox --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -v ~/tgsandbox:/home/tigergraph/tgsandbox/save tigergraphml/sandbox:1.4.0
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Here is a breakdown of the parameters in the previous command:
     * `-it`: run the container interactively and allocate a pseudo-TTY. If you’d rather run the container non-interactively, use `-d` instead. You can use `docker logs` to retrieve the URL for JupyterLab.
     * `-p`: map a port of the host (14022) to a port of the container (22).
       * Port 22: SSH server
       * Ports 9000 and 14240: TigerGraph database
       * Port 8888: ML Workbench
       * Port 6006: Tensorboard.
     * `--name`: name of the container. The command sets the name to `tgsandbox`, but you can change this to another name.
     * `--ulimit`: the limit of number of open file descriptors per process.
     * `-v`: mount a folder on the host (`~/tgsandbox`) to a folder in the container (`/home/tigergraph/tgsandbox`). These two folders are synced, allowing you to save any file even after the container is removed. However, the folder on the host (`~/tgsandbox`) has to be writable by the user inside the container. Normally, this can be ensured by making the folder public, e.g., `chmod 777 ~/tgsandbox`. If you are using Windows, change the path using Windows file system conventions. For example, `C:\tgsandbox` instead of `~/tgsandbox`.
This command prints the link to the JupyterLab workbench in a format similar to `127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=`. Use this link in your browser to access the workbench, which is a customized version of JupyterLab.


If the Docker container is running remotely, open port 8888 on the remote machine to allow the connection. Then replace `127.0.0.1` in the returned address with the remote machine IP address.   
---  
  1. If you want shell access to your Docker container, run the following command:
```
$ ssh -p 14022 tigergraph@localhost
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

When prompted for the password for user `tigergraph`, enter `tigergraph`.
Alternatively, if you don’t have access to `ssh`, you can get shell access through `docker exec`:
```
$ docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep tgsandbox | awk '{print $1}') /bin/sh
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

  2. If you turn off the sandbox container and start the container again, JupyterLab starts automatically as soon as the container starts. However, JupyterLab generates a new token everytime it restarts. You can retrieve the URL with the token by running `docker logs tgsandbox`, or click the container in the Docker Desktop UI to retrieve the URL from the latest terminal output.
