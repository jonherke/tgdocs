### Contents

After the on-prem ML Workbench setup is complete, the next step is to activate ML Workbench on your on-prem TigerGraph database instance. This is a prerequisite for some ML Workbench core functionality.
If you have any existing UDFs in your TigerGraph instance, back them up before installation by making a copy of the existing UDF file.   
---  
To activate ML Workbench on-prem, UDFs must be enabled by a TigerGraph server user with `gadmin` access. Follow the instructions here to enable UDFs: [Enable User-Defined Functions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/querying/func/query-user-defined-functions#enable-uploading-udfs-through-gsql). It is recommended that you disable UDFs again after activating ML Workbench for security reasons.
