ML Workbench is disabled by default for Free, Professional, and Enterprise instances. To get started with the ML Bundle, please contact support@tigergraph.com.   
---  
The ML Workbench can be included when you create a new database instance on TigerGraph Cloud.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/on-tgcloud#_create_a_cloud_cluster_with_ml_workbench)Create a Cloud Cluster with ML Workbench
  1. Go to <https://tgcloud.io>. Log on to your account or [sign up](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/start/overview#_get_started_with_tigergraph_cloud).
  2. Enter your payment information.
  3. Click the btn:[Create Cluster] button.
  4. From the menu at the top, select btn:[ML Workbench], then follow the same instructions as for [creating an enterprise-tier instance](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/solutions/create-a-solution).


![create cluster mlwb 3.9](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/_images/create-cluster-mlwb-3.9.png)
It will take a few minutes for your instance to be ready.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/on-tgcloud#_go_to_ml_workbench_on_tigergraph_cloud)Go to ML Workbench on TigerGraph Cloud
When your new instance is ready, it will be listed on the My Clusters page, probably at the top because it is the newest one.
![mlwb dropdown 3.9](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/_images/mlwb-dropdown-3.9.png)
From the Tools dropdown menu, choose btn:[Machine Learning Workbench].
Alternately, you can view a list of all clusters by going to the Tools menu on the left (or any nine-dot TigerGraph Suite button) and going to ML Workbench. These options only appear with Machine Learning Workbench-enabled clusters running TigerGraph version 3.8.0 or newer.
![family of apps](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/_images/family-of-apps.png)
Click on btn:[ML Workbench] to see a list of clusters with ML Workbench enabled.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/on-tgcloud#_get_started_with_ml_workbench)Get started with ML Workbench
Included with the ML Workbench is a Jupyter notebook README file to help you get started:
  * Set up secure access between your ML Workbench and your database.
  * Learn the basics so that you can begin running machine learning applications on TigerGraph Cloud.
