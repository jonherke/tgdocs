## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_tigergraph_ml_workbench_1_4)TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.4
Released May 16th, 2023.
Updates made at the pyTigerGraph layer are denoted with (pyTigerGraph), and ML Workbench functionality is denoted with (ML Workbench).
If you are using the Graph Data Science dataloaders, you must upgrade both the ML Workbench and pyTigerGraph to 1.4 at the same time. There is an incompatibility between v1.3 and v1.4 of pyTigerGraph and the corresponding ML Workbench versions.   
---  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_new_features)New features
  * Built in Graph ML models and Trainer (pyTigerGraph)
    * [Various GraphSAGE models](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/graphsage) for vertex classification and regression, as well as link prediction.
    * [NodePiece MLP model](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/nodepiece) for vertex classification.
    * [General purpose trainer](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/trainer) to enable training of Graph ML models in a concise fashion.
  * Transforms (pyTigerGraph)
    * [`PyGTemporalTransform`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/pyg_transforms) to create a sequence of subgraphs for a given batch of data, in a temporal manner.
    * [`NodePieceMLPTransform`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/nodepiece_transforms) to transform a batch produced by a NodePiece dataloader into a batch that can be fed into a PyTorch multilayer perceptron.
  * SSL Support in Kafka Dataloaders (ML Workbench & pyTigerGraph)
    * Two-way SSL encryption via Kerberos.
  * Collaborative dataloaders (ML Workbench & pyTigerGraph)
    * Use dataloaders on multiple machines to pull batches from the same Kafka queue. Helpful for data distributed model training.
  * Additional Dataloader Support (See [pyTigerGraph Release Notes](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/release-notes/))
    * `DATETIME` support in dataloaders.
    * Optional `distributed_query` parameter in dataloaders if running on distributed database clusters.
    * `stop()` function in dataloaders.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_updated_features)Updated features
  * Dataloader factory produces multiple dataloaders if `filter_by` is a list of different filters. (pyTigerGraph)
  * Improved the scalability of the NodePiece dataloader. (pyTigerGraph)


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_tigergraph_ml_workbench_1_3)TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.3
Released April 2023
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_new_features_2)New features
  * Two new [data loader classes](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/dataloaders): `HGTLoader` and `NodePiece`.
  * Callback functions to all [data loader factories](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/gds): users can write functions to process the batch in a background thread before it is passed into the training loop.
  * A delimiter parameter to all [data loader factories](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/gds): users can choose what delimiter they want to separate attributes they are loading from the graph.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_updated_features_2)Updated features
  * Template query support in the [featurizer](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/featurizer) (requires TigerGraph Database version 3.9+).
  * Data splitters to automatically perform a schema change if needed to add attributes to the database.
  * Support for multi-edges in the `upsertEdges()` function.
  * Better error messaging.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_fixes)Fixes
  * Fixed SSL certificate handling when custom certificate is used.
  * Removed ANSI escape characters from output of `.gsql()` calls.
  * Improved the logic for shuffling vertices in dataloaders when `filter_by` attribute was used.
  * Improved the batching algorithm in dataloaders so that the output batches have a consistent batch size.
  * Changed `getVertexCount()` endpoint to more scalable solution.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_tigergraph_ml_workbench_1_1_september_2022)TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.1 (September 2022)
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_new_features_3)New features
  * TensorFlow support for homogeneous GNNs via the Spektral library
  * Heterogeneous Graph Dataloading support for DGL
  * Support for lists of strings in dataloaders
  * Activator for both Community and Enterprise editions of the ML Workbench (see <https://act.tigergraphlabs.com> for details)


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_updated_features_3)Updated features
  * Fixed KeyError when creating a data loader on a graph where `PrimaryIdAsAttribute` is `False`
  * Error catch if Kafka dataloader doesn’t run in asynchronous mode
  * Schema now refreshes during dataloader instantiation and featurizer attribute addition
  * Connection instantiation time reduced
  * Reinstall query if it is disabled
  * Confirm Kafka topic is created before subscription
  * Streamlined Kafka resource usage
  * Allow multiple consumers on the same data
  * Improved deprecation warnings


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/faq/release-notes#_tigergraph_ml_workbench_1_0_august_2022)TigerGraph ML Workbench 1.0 (August 2022)
