TigerGraph ML Workbench is available as a service through TigerGraph Cloud or standalone in two editions, Community and Enterprise.
While both on-prem editions offer useful Python-level features for your data science needs, the Enterprise edition offers more powerful features to support production-level model training on enterprise-level data sets.
The tables below can help you compare the key differences between the editions.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/editions/#_ml_workbench_on_tigergraph_cloud)ML Workbench on TigerGraph Cloud
The Enterprise Edition ML Workbench is available on [TigerGraph Cloud](https://docs.tigergraph.com/ml-workbench/1.4/on-cloud/on-tgcloud), bundled together with a database instance. This is the quickest and easiest way to get started with graph machine learning.
