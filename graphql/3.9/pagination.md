# Pagination
### Contents
  * [Limitations](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/pagination#_limitations)


You can use the `limit` argument to limit the number of results you want returned from a query, and the `offset` argument to specify which slice of the results you want returned.
For example, the following query sorts its results in ascending order by the `name` property, and only returns the first three results:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  person (
   order_by : {name : asc},
   limit : 3
  )
    {name,
    gender,
    height
  }
 }
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Using the `offset` argument, we can specify the number of results to skip. The following query sorts its results in ascending order by the `name` property, only returns three results and skips the first result:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  person (
   order_by : {name : asc},
   limit : 3,
   offset : 1
  )
    {name,
    gender,
    height
  }
 }
}

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/pagination#_limitations)Limitations
The following limitations apply to pagination in TigerGraph GraphQL service:
  * When a query uses `limit` with `offset`, it must also use the [`order_by`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting) argument.
  * In a multi-hop query, pagination is only supported on root-level queries.
