# Queries
### Contents
  * [One-hop pattern](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/queries#_one_hop_pattern)
  * [N-hop patterns](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/queries#_n_hop_patterns)


In TigerGraph GraphQL service, you can create GraphQL queries to fetch specific fields of vertices and edges in a graph.
In the context of TigerGraph GraphQL service, a query refers to a GraphQL query, as opposed to a GSQL query. If we ever mean to refer to a GSQL query, we use the term "GSQL query" instead of "query".   
---  
For example, if we have the following schema in TigerGraph:
![Example schema](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/_images/example-schema.png)
Figure 1. Example schema
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/queries#_one_hop_pattern)One-hop pattern
We can write the following query to find all the people and their birthday and birth city.
  * Query
  * Results


```
query {
  DemoGraph {
  person {
   name
   birthday
   born_in {
    to {
     name
    }
   }
  }
 }
}

```

2 people are found with their names and birthday, one in Mountain View and another in Palo Alto:
```
{
 "data": {
  "DemoGraph": {
   "person": [
    {
     "born_in": [
      {
       "birthday": "1995-01-01 00:00:00",
       "to": {
        "name": "palo alto"
       }
      }
     ],
     "name": "Jenny"
    },
    {
     "born_in": [
      {
       "birthday": "1973-10-05 00:00:00",
       "to": {
        "name": "mountain view"
       }
      }
     ],
     "name": "Smith"
    }
   ]
  }
 },
 "errors": null
}

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/queries#_n_hop_patterns)N-hop patterns
In a GraphQL query, you can traverse multiple edges in a single request by nesting in the `to` field of edge objects.
If we expand on the previous 1-hop query, we can perform multiple hops in a single query. On top of a personâ€™s name and their birth city, we can write the following query to also fetch the school they attend and the city in which the school is located.
  * Query
  * Results


```
query {
  DemoGraph {
  city {
   name
   reverse_born_in {
    birthday
    to {
     name
     attend {
      to {
       name
       locate_at_To_city {
        to {
         name
        }
       }
      }
     }
    }
   }
  }
 }
}

          }
         }
