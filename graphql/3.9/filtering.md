  * [Boolean operators for columns](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering#_boolean_operators_for_columns)
  * [Filter with GSQL string expressions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering#_filter_with_gsql_string_expressions)


TigerGraph GraphQL service supports two methods of filtering:
  * Native GraphQL filtering with `where` argument
  * Filtering with GSQL string expression using `whereExpr`


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering#_filter_with_graphql_where_argument)Filter with GraphQL `where` argument
TigerGraph GraphQL service supports filtering of query output using `where` argument for both vertices and edges of the graph.
For example, the following query returns the name of everyone who is born after the year 1990:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  person(where: {
    birthYear: {_gt: 1990}, **(1)**
  }) {
    name
  }
 }
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | The value for fields used in the `where` argument must evaluate to a boolean value.  
---|---  
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering#_boolean_operators_for_columns)Boolean operators for columns
TigerGraph GraphQL service supports the following boolean operators for columns:
Operator | Description  
---|---  
`_eq` | Equal to  
`_neq` | Not equal to  
`_lt` | Less than  
`_lte` | Less than or equal to  
`_gt` | Greater than  
`_gte` | Greater than or equal to  
`_and`  
`_or`  
`_not`  
For example, `where: { birthYear: {_gt: 1990} }` filters the results to only objects whose `birthYear` field has a value greater than 1990.
Users can specify several boolean conditions and combine them using `and`, `or`, and `not` operators:
  * Example 1
  * Example 2
  * Example 3


Select persons who are married and born after 1990 year:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  person(where: {
   _and: [
    {birthYear: {_gt: 1990}},
    {married: {_eq: true}}
   ]
  }) {
   name,
   birthYear
  }
 }
}

```

Select cities where the population is less than or equal to 100k or tax rate is less than 5%:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  city(where: {
   _or: [
    {population: {_lte: 100000}},
    {taxRate: {_lt: 5}}
   ]
  }) {
   name
  }
 }
}

```

Select companies whose zip code is not 94403:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  company(where: {
   _not: {zipcode: {_eq: "94403"}}
  }) {
   name
  }
 }
}

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering#_filter_with_gsql_string_expressions)Filter with GSQL string expressions
TigerGraph GraphQL Service supports filtering the result of a GraphQL query using the `whereExpr` argument. The value for the `whereExpr` argument is a string with conditions written in GSQL. This allows you to use complex conditions involving column comparisons as well as [functions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/querying/func/) in the GSQL query language.
`where` and `whereExpr` conditions cannot be used at the same time.   
---  
For example, you can use the [`LIKE` operator](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/querying/operators-and-expressions#_like) in GSQL to filter for vertices whose name start with a specified substring:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  city(whereExpr: "name like \"San%\"") {
   name
  }
 }
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

`WhereExpr` conditions has support for the entire GSQL expression syntax including GSQL built-in functions and operators. See more in [Operators and Expressions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/3.9/querying/operators-and-expressions), and [Functions](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/3.9/querying/func/).
