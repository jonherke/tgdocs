# Sorting
### Contents
  * [Sort by single column](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting#_sort_by_single_column)
  * [Sort by multiple columns](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting#_sort_by_multiple_columns)
  * [Limitations](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting#_limitations)


You can sort the results of a query by using the `order_by` argument. The value for the `order_by` argument expects either of the following:
  * An input object, with the name of the column to sort by as the key, and either `asc` or `desc` as the value to decide whether to sort in ascending or descending order
  * An array of input objects, which will sort the query results by multiple columns


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting#_sort_by_single_column)Sort by single column
For example, the following query will sort its results for `person` vertices by the property `name` in alphabetical order.
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  person (
    order_by : {name : asc}
  ) {
   name,
   gender,
   height
  }
 }
}

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting#_sort_by_multiple_columns)Sort by multiple columns
To sort by multiple fields, put the different fields and sort orders in an array. The following query will sort its results for `person` vertices first by `name` in ascending order, and then by `height` in descending order:
```
{
  DemoGraph {
  person (
   order_by : [
    {name : asc},
    {height :desc}
   ]
  ) {
   name,
   gender,
   height
  }
 }
}

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting#_limitations)Limitations
The following limitations apply for sorting in TigerGraph GraphQL Service:
  * In a multi-hop query, you can only sort results by root-level vertices
  * Only columns with values of the following types can be used for sorting:
    * Uint64
    * Int64
    * Float
    * String
    * Datetime
