TigerGraph GraphQL Service translates TigerGraph’s GSQL schema into a GraphQL schema. Vertices and edges are translated to Object types in GraphQL, and outgoing and incoming reverse edges in GSQL schema are mapped to fields in the corresponding vertex type. Vertex types are included as fields in top-level type for the entire graph.
Within the GraphQL client, you can click on the **Schema** button on the right side of the screen to view the entire GraphQL schema.
Currently, TigerGraph GraphQL service cannot automatically react to schema changes happening in TigerGraph. When a schema change happens, you need to restart the service to keep the GraphQL schema in sync with TigerGraph schema.   
---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_query)Query
Every GraphQL schema starts with a top level `Query` type. The `Query` type only has one field whose name and type name are the same as the GSQL graph name.
If you have a graph in GSQL named `DemoGraph`, then in your GraphQL schema, there will be the following type `Query`:
```
type Query { **(1)**
  DemoGraph: DemoGraph
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | Top level query type with a single field named after the graph the service is connected to.  
---|---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_graph)Graph
The [graph](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/ddl-and-loading/defining-a-graph-schema#_create_graph) connected to the service is translated into an Object type in GraphQL, with all vertex types included as fields in top-level type for the entire graph. Each vertex field has five arguments: `where`, `whereExpr`, `order_by`, `limit`, and `offset`, which are used for [filtering](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering), [sorting](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting) and [pagination](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/pagination).
For example, suppose to have the following schema in TigerGraph:
![Example schema](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/_images/example-schema.png)
Figure 1. Example schema
The following is a portion of the translated GraphQL schema for the Graph:
```
type DemoGraph { **(1)**
 city( **(2)**
  where: cityFilter
  whereExpr: String
  order_by: cityOrderBy
  limit: Int
  offset: Int
 ): [city]
 person(
  where: personFilter
  whereExpr: String
  order_by: personOrderBy
  limit: Int
  offset: Int
 ): [person]
…
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | `DemoGraph` type contains fields for all vertices, in this case `person` and `city`, `school`, `company` and `skill`.  
---|---  
**2** | Each vertex field has the same [arguments](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#arguments): `where`, `whereExpr`, `order_by`, `limit`, and `offset`, which are used for [filtering](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/filtering), [sorting](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/sorting) and [pagination](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/pagination).  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_vertex_types)Vertex types
Each [vertex type](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/ddl-and-loading/defining-a-graph-schema#_create_vertex) in GSQL will be translated into an [Object type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) in GraphQL. Edge types connected to the vertex type are mapped to fields on the corresponding vertex object. Therefore, the `city` and `person` vertex types have the following GraphQL schema.
```
type person {
 birthYear: Int64 **(1)**
 gender: String
 height: Float
 id: String
 married: Boolean
 name: String
 born_in(where: born_inFilter, whereExpr: String): [born_in] **(2)**
 ...
}
type city {
 id: String
 name: String
 population: Int64
 taxRate: Float
 ...
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | Vertex type properties in GraphQL are translated to object type fields.  
---|---  
**2** | Edges are mapped to fields on the corresponding object.  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_edge_types)Edge types
Edge types are translated differently depending on whether the edge is directed or undirected.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_directed_edges)Directed edges
A directed edge type is translated into a single GraphQL Object type, with properties of the edge type mapped to fields of the edge Object type. In addition, the `TO` vertex connected to the edge is mapped to a field of the corresponding edge Object type.
For example, if a `born_in` directed edge type pointing from the `person` vertex type and to the `city` vertex type will be translated into the following:
```
type born_in {
 birthday: Datetime
 to(where: cityFilter, whereExpr: String): city
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

#### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_reverse_edges)Reverse edges
In GSQL, you can enable `WITH REVERSE_EDGE` on directed edge types. Doing so creates a directed edge type pointing in the reversed direction of the original edge type, and a prefix `rev` is added to the name of the edge.
Reverse edges types are treated the same as any other directed edge when translated into GraphQL schema.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/graphql/3.9/schema#_undirected_edges)Undirected edges
An undirected edge type is translated into two GraphQL Object types, one for each direction. The two Object types are distinguished by a `From_<type>` prefix to indicate the direction of the edge.
An exception is the case of self-edges, where the `FROM` and `TO` vertex types of the edge are the same. In this case, the undirected edge type will be translated into a single Object type, with the vertex type it is connected to mapped to the `to` field of the edge Object type.
For example, if an undirected `partner` edge exists between two vertex types `company` and `school`, the translated GraphQL Object type will include two Object types:
```
type From_company_partner {
  to(where: schoolFilter, whereExpr: String): school
}
type From_school_partner {
  to(where: companyFilter, whereExpr: String): company
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

However, if an undirected self-edge `is_friend_of` exists between `person` vertices, the edge type will only be translated into a single GraphQL object type.
```
type is_friend_of {
 to(where: personFilter, whereExpr: String): person
}
graphql![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!
