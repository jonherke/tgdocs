## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-cloud-account#_creating_an_account)Creating an account
Only an Organization Admin can create a new user account for someone else to use. Organization Members and Organization Cluster Admins cannot create their own accounts; they need to be invited via email after their accounts are created for them.
See [Invite new users](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_invite_new_users) for more detailed instructions.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-cloud-account#_account_name)Account name
Your user account is displayed in the order [First Name] [Last Name] in the list of users in the organization account.
Changing your display name is not currently supported by TigerGraph Cloud Classic. To change your name, an Organization Admin needs to remove your account and send a new invitation for you to make a new account.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-cloud-account#_account_permissions)Account permissions
Search for your own name under the **Users** tab to see what role you have been given in the organization. If you believe you have been given the wrong organization role in error, contact an Organization Admin for them to change your role.
See [Organization roles and privileges](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_organization_roles_and_privileges) for detailed information on the privileges available to each organization role.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-cloud-account#_reset_your_tigergraph_cloud_classic_user_account_password)Reset your TigerGraph Cloud Classic user account password
