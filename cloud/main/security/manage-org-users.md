When you set up a TigerGraph Cloud Classic account, you are granted the privileges of an Organization Admin for your company.
TigerGraph Cloud Classic allows an Organization Admin to manage multiple users in your organization and control their access to various clusters.
This page explains the user access controls. For help with setting up clusters, visit [Create a Cluster](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/solutions/create-a-solution).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_invite_new_users)Invite new users
The account that creates an organization is automatically given the role of an Organization Admin. The first time you log in to a new organization account, you have the opportunity to add additional users to your organization with different roles and privileges.
![invite more users](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/_images/invite-more-users.png)
You can also add users later by going to the Access Management page under the sidebar button **Users** in the TigerGraph Cloud Classic interface.
![access management](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/_images/access-management.png)
Invitations will expire after seven days. If an invitation expires, resend the invitation.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_organization_roles_and_privileges)Organization roles and privileges
The privileges granted to the various roles in a TigerGraph Cloud Classic organization are as follows:
Action | Organization Member | Organization Cluster Admin | Organization Admin  
---|---|---|---  
Can add and remove new members | No 🚫 | No 🚫 | Yes ✅  
Can view organization billing information | No 🚫 | No 🚫 | Yes ✅  
Can create new clusters | No 🚫 | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅  
Can view cluster activities | No 🚫 | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅  
Can shut down/modify an existing cluster | No 🚫 | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅  
Can view cluster data | Only if assigned to the cluster | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅  
Can access GraphStudio | Only if assigned to the cluster | Only if assigned to the cluster | Only if assigned to the cluster  
User management was redesigned with the release of TigerGraph v3.6.0 in July 2022. Clusters created before then are only visible to Organization Admins and Cluster Admins. These legacy clusters exist entirely outside of the User Management system and can still be accessed by ordinary users with the URL.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_tigergraph_solution_roles)TigerGraph solution roles
A user in an organization on TigerGraph Cloud Classic is separate from a user on a TigerGraph cluster. On TigerGraph Cloud Classic, a single user in an organization may be assigned to several clusters and have various roles on those clusters.
In this documentation, for consistency, we will refer to these using the terms "organization role" and "cluster role."
For information about the TigerGraph cluster roles, see the page [Access Control Model in TigerGraph](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/access-control-model).
When a TigerGraph Cloud Classic user is added to a cluster as an Organization Cluster Admin or Organization Admin, they are granted the `superuser` role on that cluster. A user added to a cluster as an Organization Member has no role on the cluster by default, but can be assigned a cluster role by anyone with the `superuser` cluster role.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_access_management)Access Management
In the Access Management section on the Users page, you can check the invitation status of each user who has been sent an invitation and also invite new users.
Click on the three-dot menu **•••** to modify a user’s role or delete the account. Deleting the account removes the user from all clusters in the organization.
Click **Invite Users** in the upper-right corner of the page to send out more email invitations to new users and place them in various roles.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/manage-org-users#_cluster_management)Cluster Management
On the **My Clusters** page, click the third button in the Actions row for each cluster to enter the **Cluster Access Management** page. From there, you can grant or revoke access to the cluster for different users.
