## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/start/get_started#_sign_up)Sign up
Click **Sign Up** on the [TigerGraph Cloud Classic landing page](https://classic.tgcloud.io/).
When you register for a new TigerGraph Cloud Classic account, you create an Organization Account to which you can later invite other users.
![TigerGraph Cloud Classic Create Organization page](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/start/_images/create-organization.png)
Create a new account with a company name, personal name, and email address.
If you are signing up for the first time, you will be prompted to enter a password. Please note the [Password Policy](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/security/password-policy) that applies to TigerGraph Cloud Classic.
After completing the signup page, you will get a link to verify your email address. Click the link in your email to verify, then log in using your username and password.
If you have already verified your email address, you can still create a new organization on the Sign Up page. The system recognizes a verified email address on the registration page and allows you to create a new organization with the same credentials.
TigerGraph recommends enterprise customers use a shared mailbox to set up an organization account. TigerGraph Cloud Classic sends important email notifications to this address, including for:
  * Billing and credits
  * Cluster behavior
  * New cloud products

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/cloud/main/start/get_started#_log_in)Log in
Click **Log In** on the [TigerGraph Cloud Classic landing page](https://classic.tgcloud.io/).
When you log in, you must first provide an organization name before entering your username and password. If you were invited by a member of your organization and you do not know the name used for the organization account, contact your organization’s administrator.
Once logged in, you can create clusters and add more users to your organization.

Most of the documentation for TigerGraph Enterprise Server also applies to TigerGraph Cloud Classic. However, since TigerGraph Cloud Classic does not have a command-line interface on the OS level, command-line features are not supported in the same way. In many cases, there is a GUI-based method for the same feature. For advanced OS-level commands, submit a support ticket for more information.
