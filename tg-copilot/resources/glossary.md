Item | Description  
---|---  
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) | RAG is a hybrid approach that combines a retrieval system with a generative model. It retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base which is then used by a transformer-based model to generate responses.  
LLM (Large Language Model) | Large Language Models are types of artificial intelligence models trained on vast amounts of text data. They are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, and are used for tasks such as translation, summarization, and conversation.  
LLM Provider | An LLM provider refers to a company or organization that offers Large Language Models (LLMs) as a service.  
LLM Provider API Key | The API key verifies the identity of the requester, ensuring that the request is coming from a registered and authorized user or application.  
Self-Managed | Refers to a software or platform that is hosted and managed by the user’s own team, rather than being provided as a service by a third party. It involves handling the setup, maintenance, and management of the software.  
Service Account | A service account is a non-human user account used by applications and services to interact with software APIs or other tools. It provides a way to grant access to resources programmatically, without using individual user credentials.  
PII (Personally Identifiable Information) | PII refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Examples include names, addresses, email addresses, and social security numbers.  
LangChain | LangChain is a library that allows developers to integrate language models into applications. It provides tools for building applications that combine language understanding and generation capabilities.  
Swagger | Swagger (now known as OpenAPI) is a set of tools for building, documenting, and consuming REST APIs. It helps standardize the process of API integration and documentation.  
Python | Python programming language, known for its simplicity and versatility, used widely in data science, web development, automation, and many other areas of software development.  
Weights and Biases | Weights and Biases is a machine learning platform that helps track experiments, visualize data, and automate model optimization. It is widely used for tracking and visualizing the training of models.  
Test Suite | A test suite in software development is a collection of test cases intended to verify that a software system meets its design specifications and behaves as expected.  
Docker | Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
