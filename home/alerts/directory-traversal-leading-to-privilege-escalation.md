# Alert: Directory Traversal leading to Privilege Escalation

  * [Mitigation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/home/alerts/directory-traversal-leading-to-privilege-escalation#_mitigation)

Type: Security
Original report: Feb 28, 2023
A high severity directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in versions 3.1.0 to 3.8.0 of the software. The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system and gain elevated privileges.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/home/alerts/directory-traversal-leading-to-privilege-escalation#_impact)Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and potentially take control of the affected system.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/home/alerts/directory-traversal-leading-to-privilege-escalation#_mitigation)Mitigation
This vulnerability will be mitigated in version 3.9.1 and future releases of the software. We strongly recommend that all users update to the latest version as soon as possible. TigerGraph Administrators may also revoke execute LOADING JOB privileges from users (see [Role Management](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/role-management)), until fixes for this issue are in place.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/home/alerts/directory-traversal-leading-to-privilege-escalation#_note)Note
It is important to follow best practices for security and keep all software up-to-date to prevent potential exploits.
We would like to thank Neo4j for bringing this issue to our attention.
