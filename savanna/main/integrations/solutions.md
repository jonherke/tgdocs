TigerGraph Savanna offers pre-built solution kits that address common use cases and industry-specific challenges. These solutions provide a starting point for your graph database projects, offering pre-configured schemas, sample data, and query templates.
By leveraging solutions, you can accelerate development, reduce time-to-insights, and focus on extracting value from your graph data.  
---  
We limit the number of solutions that can be installed in a workspace to one to ensure that the workspace is not overloaded with unnecessary data and queries.  
---  
Explore the available solutions and experiment with them in your own specific use cases.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/integrations/solutions#_prerequisites)Prerequisites
To start creating your first solution you will need to have a [Read-Write Workspace](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/workgroup-workspace/workspaces/readwrite-readonly#_read_write_rw_workspace) already created.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/integrations/solutions#_get_started_with_solutions)Get Started with Solutions
To get started with solutions follow the steps below:
  1. Navigate to the **Solutions** tab in the left navigation.
![Screenshot 2024 04 27 at 2.34.38 PM](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/integrations/_images/Screenshot%202024-04-27%20at%202.34.38 PM.png)
  2. The soutlions panel will appear. Here you can choose between TigerGraph’s pre-build solution options. For this example we will chose **Transaction Fraud**.

  3. Click on the **Add** button of the selected solution kit to start the solution builder.
![Screenshot 2024 04 18 at 10.17.39 AM](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/integrations/_images/Screenshot%202024-04-18%20at%2010.17.39 AM.png)
  4. You can give your solution a name. And select the workspace you want your solution to be installed to.
Currently, you can only install solutions on RW workspaces.

  5. For each solution kit, you are provided with three options to choose from regarding the data:
![Screenshot 2024 04 18 at 10.18.53 AM](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/integrations/_images/Screenshot%202024-04-18%20at%2010.18.53 AM.png)
     * **Sample Data** : This option allows you to use pre-loaded sample data that comes with the solution kit. Sample data is designed to showcase the capabilities and features of the solution kit. It provides a ready-to-use dataset that you can explore and interact with immediately.
This option is useful if you want to quickly evaluate the solution kit or understand its functionality without the need to load your own data.  
---  
     * **Load Your Own Data** : With this option, you have the flexibility to load your own data into the solution kit. You can import your data from various sources, such as CSV files, databases, or other data formats supported by TigerGraph.
For more details on loading data see [Load Data in TigerGraph Savanna](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/).  
---  
     * **No Data** : If you choose the **No Data** option, the solution kit will be set up without any pre-loaded or user-provided data. It provides you with pre-defined graph schema and queries, where you can load your own data afterward using GSQL Editor or Data Ingestion.
This option is useful if you want to start with a clean slate and build your blank solution from scratch.  
---  
  6. Once your created your solution, it will show up under the **Solutions** tab
