TigerGraph Savanna offers a flexible and transparent pricing model designed to accommodate a wide range of usage scenarios, from small-scale projects to large enterprise deployments. Our pricing structure is crafted to provide you with the best value while ensuring your graph database solutions are scalable, reliable, and high-performing.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_select_platform_and_region)Select Platform and Region
Platform  AWS GCP (Coming soon) Azure (Coming soon) Region  US East (N. Virginia) - Tier 1 US East (Ohio) - Tier 1 US West (Oregon) - Tier 1 Europe (Frankfurt) - Tier 3 Europe (Ireland) - Tier 2 Europe (London) - Tier 2 South America (Sao Paulo) - Tier 4 Asia Pacific (Singapore) - Tier 3 Asia Pacific (Sydney) - Tier 3 Asia Pacific (Tokyo) - Tier 3
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_compute_pricing)Compute Pricing
Compute resources on TigerGraph Savanna are billed based on the number of TCRs consumed per hour.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_tigergraph_credits)TigerGraph Credits
A TigerGraph Credit (TCR) is a unit that represents the cost of using compute resources on TigerGraph Savanna. By using TCRs, you can easily scale your compute resources up or down to meet your performance needs without worrying about complex pricing structures.
The exchange rate for TigerGraph Credits is straightforward:
**1 TCR = $4.00**
This means that for every TigerGraph Credit you consume, you will be billed $4.00.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_compute_pricing_table)Compute Pricing Table
The following table outlines the cost in TCRs for different sizes of compute resources. The compute costs are distinct from the storage fees listed below and are metered based on actual usage. For inquiries about pricing, volume discounts, or deploying in other regions, please contact us at sales@tigergraph.com.
Prices depend on your region. The table automatically adjusts to the region you select above.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_high_availability_ha)High Availability (HA)
High Availability (HA) on TigerGraph Savanna ensures your graph database remains operational even during disruptions. When HA is enabled, the price is calculated using a multiplier based on the size of your TigerGraph compute resource.
Compute Size | Replica Factor | Cost Multiplier  
---|---|---  
Sizes equal or below TG-8 | 3 | 2.8x  
Sizes above TG-8 | 2 | 1.95x  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_storage_pricing)Storage Pricing
Storage on TigerGraph Savanna is billed separately from compute resources. Storage fees are calculated based on the amount of data stored and are metered with fine-grained precision to ensure you only pay for what you use. This includes the storage of your graph data, backups, and any associated metadata. Our storage pricing is designed to be transparent and flexible, allowing you to scale your storage needs up or down as required.
Tier | Price per average GB per Month  
---|---  
Tier 1 | $0.025  
Tier 2 | $0.027  
Tier 3 | $0.028  
Tier 4 | $0.044  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing#_add_on_pricing)Add-on Pricing
TigerGraph Savanna offers a variety of add-ons to enhance your graph database experience. Each add-on is priced individually, allowing you to customize your TigerGraph Savanna environment to fit your specific needs and budget. Add-ons are billed monthly and can be added or removed at any time to provide maximum flexibility.
Add-On | Scope | Price  
---|---|---  
Insights | Workspace | 10% of the compute usage  
GraphStudio™ | Workspace | Free  
GraphQL | Workspace | Free
