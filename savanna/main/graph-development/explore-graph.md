Explore graph allow users to visually interact with their graph data. Use it to help navigate and understand complex data structures by displaying connections and dependencies.
A visual representation of a graph and its data can help identify and explain the relationships between different data points or entities.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/explore-graph/#_prerequisites)Prerequisites
Before you can utilize the Explore Graph features you need to [Create a Workspace](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/workgroup-workspace/workgroups/how2-create-a-workgroup) and [Load Data](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/explore-graph/#_pattern_search)[Pattern Search](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/explore-graph/how2-use-pattern-search)
Learn how look for specific patterns or sequences within a dataset or system.
