Efficiently loading data into your TigerGraph databases is crucial for successful graph analysis.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/#_load_data_overview)Load Data Overview
TigerGraph Savanna offers multiple methods for loading data:
  1. Select an active workspace from the dropdown menu.
![Screenshot 2024 04 17 at 5.47.58 PM](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/_images/Screenshot%202024-04-17%20at%205.47.58 PM.png)
  2. Click on ![Screenshot 2024 04 17 at 5.48.20 PM](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/_images/Screenshot%202024-04-17%20at%205.48.20 PM.png) to load your data into TigerGraph.
  3. Chose one of TigerGraph Savanna various types of connectors that allow you to load data into your graph database.
![data sources](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/_images/data-sources.png)
  4. The data loading tool offers two different approaches to make it easier for users to load their data based on their specific needs and preferences.
     * **Step-by-Step Guide** : The data loading tool includes a user-friendly interface that guides you through the data loading process step-by-step. This approach is suitable for users who prefer a visual and interactive experience.
The step-by-step guides helps you:
       * Configure the data source.
       * Map the data to your graph schema.
       * Customize import options.
     * **GSQL Template** : Is for users who prefer a more programmatic approach or have complex data loading requirements. The GSQL template option allows you to define custom data loading logic using GSQL scripts. So, you have more flexibility and control over the data loading process.
You can leverage GSQL’s powerful features to transform, validate, and load data from various sources into your graph database.

When selecting a data source a step-by-step guide might not always be available. When this is the case users will see **Open in GSQL Editor** on the bottom right of the panel.
![open in gsql editor](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/_images/open-in-gsql-editor.png)
As of Oct. 31, 2024, the step-by-step guide supports loading from [Local File](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/load-from-local), [Amazon S3](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/load-from-s3), [Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/load-from-gcs) and [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/graph-development/load-data/load-from-blob). We are actively working on adding support for more data sources.
