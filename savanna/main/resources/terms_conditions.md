## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/terms_conditions#_updated_jan_20_2025)(updated Jan 20, 2025)
These TigerGraph Savanna Subscription Terms (“Subscription Terms”) are part of a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) between the person or entity agreeing to these terms (“Customer”) and TigerGraph, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and includes these Subscription Terms, any terms expressly incorporated herein by reference, and any terms in a fully executed ordering document that incorporates these Subscription Terms (an “Order Schedule”). This Agreement is effective as of the date the Order Schedule is fully executed (the “Effective Date”).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/terms_conditions#_1_subscription)1. Subscription
1.1. Subscription Services. Subject to the provisions of these Subscription Terms, TigerGraph will provide certain cloud-based Software services (“Cloud Services”) as specified on an Order Schedule for the period specified in the applicable Order Schedule (the “Subscription Period”). The Cloud Services will be provided in accordance with the: (i) Order Schedule (ii) Documentation, (iii) SLA, and (iv) Support Policy.
1.2 Definitions. “Software” means the TigerGraph Enterprise database software and related tools. “Console” means the web-based user interface that Customer shall use to access the Cloud Services. “Customer Data” means all proprietary, non-public electronic data or information submitted to the Cloud Services by Customer. “Documentation” means the materials available at docs.tigergraph.com, as amended from time to time. “SLA” means the TigerGraph Savanna SLA available at www.tigergraph.com/terms, as amended from time to time. “Support Policy” means the terms set forth in the TigerGraph Support Policy available at www.tigergraph.com/terms as amended from time to time.
1.3 Modifications; Discontinuation of Service. TigerGraph may make modifications to the Cloud Services or components of the Cloud Services, including the Software, from time to time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer of any material modifications. TigerGraph reserves the right to discontinue offering the Cloud Services at the conclusion of Customer’s then-current Subscription Period.
1.4 TigerGraph Savanna Free Tier Users and Free Credit. TigerGraph may allow Customer to use the Cloud Services on a no-fee basis, including through the provision of free credit that can be used on Cloud Services. If such no-fee use or free credit is allowed, TigerGraph shall not be subject to the SLA, Support Policy, and the warranties set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2. Customer’s free use of the TigerGraph Savanna Services may be terminated at any time at TigerGraph’s discretion.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/terms_conditions#_2_payment)2. Payment
2.1. Fees. Customer will pay all fees specified in the Order Schedule for Cloud Services (“Fees”). If the Order Schedule specifies a subscription basis, all Fees are due 30 days from the invoice date. If the Order Schedule specifies a pay-as-you-go basis, Customer shall provide a credit card for the payment of Fees. For the pay-as-you-go basis, Customer authorizes a recurring monthly charge to your credit card based on our current fee schedule for the Cloud Services. All Fees are non-refundable and non-cancelable. Unless otherwise specified in the Order Schedule, all Fees are in U.S. dollars and shall be paid without setoff or deduction. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Schedule, upon renewal of the Subscription Period, the Fees will be the then-current list price for Cloud Services.
2.2. Taxes. Customer is responsible for any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than TigerGraph’s income tax) associated with the Cloud Services and professional services, including any related penalties or interest (“Taxes”), and shall pay the listed Fees without deduction for Taxes. If Customer is required by applicable law to withhold any amount from any payments specified in the Order Schedule, then Customer will pay TigerGraph the listed Fees as if no withholding were required, and shall remit the withholding to the appropriate governmental authorities on behalf of TigerGraph, with a copy of the tax receipt or certificate forwarded to TigerGraph.
2.3. Delinquencies. Any late payments will accrue late charges at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
2.4 Bursting. Customer agrees that the Cloud Services may enable Customer to exceed the use limits defined in the Service Order, provided that if such use is repeated or excessive, as determined by TigerGraph, TigerGraph may invoice Customer, and Customer will pay for, the number of required additional use, prorated over the remaining Subscription Period. In no event shall Customer’s no-charge bursting use exceed 50 percent of the use amount for the Subscription Period, and any no-charge bursting shall be limited to thirty (30) total days within the Subscription Period. If Customer declines to increase the use limits as recommended by TigerGraph or otherwise refuses to cooperate with TigerGraph to increase its licensed use, TigerGraph may suspend Customer’s use of the Cloud Services, until such time as Customer is able to reduce its use to the licensed levels.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/terms_conditions#_3_restrictions)3. Restrictions
All rights in the Software, Console, and Cloud Services not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved to TigerGraph or its licensors. Without limiting the foregoing (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law), Customer shall not, and shall not permit others under its control to: (1) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software, Console, or any component of the Cloud Services; (2) assign, sublicense, transfer, lease, rent or otherwise distribute or make available the Software or Console, or Cloud Services to any third party; (3) use the Cloud Services for High Risk Activities or otherwise contrary to the Documentation; (4) use the Cloud Services to create, deliver training on, improve (directly or indirectly) or offer a substantially similar product or service; (5) reconfigure the Cloud Services without prior written consent from TigerGraph; (6) use the included ODBC driver to connect to other distributions of the components of the Software, or (7) perform benchmarking of the Cloud Services. “High Risk Activities” means uses such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems, where the use or failure of the Software could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage. The Software includes the third party software and material specified at <https://docs.tigergraph.com> (“Third Party Software”).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/terms_conditions#_4_proprietary_rights_data)4. Proprietary Rights; Data
4.1. License. The Cloud services do not include the separate licensing or any sale of Software. Subject to the provisions of these Subscription Terms and Order Schedule, TigerGraph grants Customer a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, terminable license to access the Software provided with the Cloud Services during the Subscription Period, subject to any license parameters specified in the applicable Order Schedule. As between the parties, all intellectual property rights in the Software and Cloud Services shall remain with TigerGraph or its licensors. Software and Cloud Services may be updated at any time. If TigerGraph materially reduces the Cloud Services, if practicable, TigerGraph will provide reasonable notice of no less than six months prior notice to Customer.
4.2. Federal Agency Users. The Software was developed solely at private expense and is commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.
4.3. Feedback. If Customer provides any suggestions or feedback regarding the Software, Console, or Cloud Services, TigerGraph may use such information without obligation to Customer, and Customer hereby irrevocably assigns to TigerGraph all right, title, and interest in that feedback or those suggestions.
4.4. Customer Data. As between TigerGraph and Customer, all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data is owned exclusively by Customer. Customer is solely responsible for the content of Customer data. Customer will not expose sensitive or regulated Customer Data in unencrypted format to TigerGraph. Customer hereby authorizes and consents to TigerGraph access, process, and store Customer Data solely as required to provide the Cloud Services. Customer will obtain any consents from Customer’s end users that are required for Customer to pass the Customer Data to TigerGraph to provide the Cloud Services.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement (or any portion hereof) is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the provision (or portion) will be enforced to the extent possible consistent with the stated intention of the parties, or, if incapable of enforcement, will be deemed to be severed and deleted from this Agreement, while the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.

11.14. Updates. Except as expressly provided herein, no modification of this Agreement will be effective unless contained in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
