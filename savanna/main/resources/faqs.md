### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_why_dont_i_see_a_password_reset_email)**Q: Why don’t I see a password reset email?**
A: If you clicked "forgot password" during sign in to Cloud and never received an email, there could be a few explanations.
  * If you requested a password reset from an organization login screen, you won’t get an email if you don’t belong to that organization. Try resetting your password from the main login page at [tgcloud.io](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/tgcloud.io).
  * If you signed up through Google authentication, you cannot use a password to log in to the same account. Try logging in with your Google account.
  * Check your junk/spam email folder or run a search for "TigerGraph" in case the email automatically got filtered to another inbox.
  * Double-check the email address you entered to make sure it matches the one you signed up with.


If you’re still unable to log in or reset your password, contact TigerGraph Support at support@tigergraph.com for individualized help with your issue.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_how_do_i_determine_the_instance_needed_for_my_workload)**Q: How do I determine the instance needed for my workload?**
A: To determine the appropriate instance for your workload, follow these guidelines:
  * **Check Available Instance Types:** Refer to [Resources](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/) to see the instance types offered by each cloud provider in each region. Larger graphs require more RAM, while higher performance necessitates both more CPUs and more RAM.
  * **Use the Pricing Table:** Our [pricing table](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/pricing) provides initial recommendations for which instance to start with based on the amount of data you plan to load into the graph. This input data is referred to as your "raw data." TigerGraph reorganizes your data into a graph, encoding and compressing it. Typically, the stored graph will be about 70% of the size of your raw data, although this is a conservative estimate and it’s often smaller.
  * **Consider RAM Requirements:** In addition to storage, you need sufficient RAM for graph querying and computation. Different applications of TigerGraph can require varying amounts of RAM. We recommend that your total RAM be about 1.5 times the maximum amount of raw data you expect to load.
  * **Scale as Needed:** If you find you need more space or compute power, you can easily scale up your instance.
  * **Use Tools for Assistance:**
    * [Workspace Size Suggestion](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/workgroup-workspace/workspaces/settings#_workspace_size_suggestion): This tool helps you determine the appropriate instance size for your workload.
    * [Cost Estimation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/overview/cost-estimation): This tool helps you estimate the cost of your TigerGraph Savanna environment.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_what_is_a_workgroup_workspace_database)**Q: What is a workgroup, workspace, database?**
A: In TigerGraph Savanna, the concepts of workgroup, workspace, and database are used to organize and manage projects and data within the platform. Here’s a breakdown of each term:
  * Workgroup: A workgroup represents a project or a logical group within TigerGraph Savanna. It serves as a container that holds multiple workspaces and databases related to a specific use case, team, or application. Workgroups provide a way to organize and manage resources, access controls, and configurations for a particular project or initiative.
  * Workspace: A workspace is a compute unit within a TigerGraph database. It is where the graph processing and analytics take place. TigerGraph Savanna supports two types of workspaces: read-write workspaces and read-only workspaces.
    * Read-write workspaces: These workspaces allow read and write operations on the graph data. They are typically used for data ingestion, data updates, and running queries that modify the graph structure or properties.
    * Read-only workspaces: These workspaces are optimized for read-intensive operations. They are used for executing queries and analytics on the graph data without modifying it. Read-only workspaces provide improved performance and scalability for read operations.
  * Database: The database in TigerGraph Savanna refers to the actual data stored within the platform. It is separate from the workspaces and can be associated with one or more workspaces within a workgroup. It holds the persistent data that is loaded into TigerGraph and is accessible for graph analytics and visualization. We only support a maximum of one ready-write workspace to connect to a database.


By utilizing workgroups, workspaces, and databases, TigerGraph Savanna provides a flexible and scalable environment for managing projects, allocating compute resources, and working with graph data effectively. The separation of compute and storage in workspaces allows for optimized performance and resource allocation, while the databases ensure the persistence and accessibility of the graph data.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_is_there_a_warm_up_period_for_tigergraph_workspaces)**Q: Is there a warm-up period for TigerGraph workspaces?**
A: When you provision or restart a workspace, there will be a warm-up period for the workspace. The larger the data size and the greater the size of workspace, the longer the warm-up period will be.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_what_is_the_difference_between_stopping_pausing_and_terminating_a_workspace)**Q: What is the difference between stopping, pausing, and terminating a workspace?**
A:
Stopping a Workspace:
  * **Action** : Shuts down the workspace without listening to incoming requests.
  * **State** : The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state.
  * **Billing** : Billing for the machine instance stops, but you will still incur charges for disk storage and backups.
  * **Backups** : Scheduled backups stop, but existing backup copies are kept in storage.
  * **Recovery** : You can start the workspace again, and after a warmup period, it will return to its previous state.


Pausing a Workspace:
  * **Action** : Suspends the workspace but listening to incoming requests.
  * **State** : The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state.
  * **Billing** : Billing for the machine instance stops, but you will still incur charges for disk storage and backups.
  * **Backups** : Scheduled backups stop, but existing backup copies are kept in storage.
  * **Recovery** : The workspace will resume automatically if incoming requests are detected or can be manually started. After a warmup period, it will return to its previous state.


Terminating a Workspace:
  * **Action** : Deprovisions the workspace and the attached disk space.
  * **State** : The workspace and all its data are deleted according to the cloud platform’s policies.
  * **Billing** : All associated billing stops, including for the virtual machine instance, disk storage, and backups.
  * **Backups** : We will keep the latest backup in storage for 15 days and then delete.
  * **Recovery** : The workspace cannot be recovered once terminated.


In summary:
  * **Stopping** : Shuts down the workspace but keeps data and backups; can be restarted.
  * **Pausing** : Suspends the workspace while still listening for requests.
  * **Terminating** : Completely deletes the workspace and its data; cannot be recovered.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_high_availability_and_replication)High Availability and Replication
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_what_kind_of_replicas_does_tigergraph_savanna_support)**Q: What kind of replicas does TigerGraph Savanna support?**
A: TigerGraph Distributed Cloud offers active-active replication for increased availability and automatic failover.
A TigerGraph system with High Availability (HA) is a cluster of server machines which uses replication to provide continuous service when one or more servers are not available or when some service components fail. TigerGraph HA service provides loading balancing when all components are operational, as well as automatic failover in the event of a service disruption.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#q-what-is-the-replication-factor)**Q: What is the replication factor?**
A: Replication factor means how many copies of data are stored, each on a separate machine. You can enable HA, which adds a replication factor of 2 or 3 for your workspace. For workspaces TG-8 and below, the replication factor is set to 3 if HA is enabled. For TG-16 and above, the replication factor is set to 2 if HA is enabled.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#q-what-is-the-partition-factor)**Q: What is the partition factor?**
A: Partition factor means the number of parts or components your graph data is split into, which also equals the number of instances that collectively store one copy of the full graph. For example, if you select a partition factor of 3, each instance will hold approximately 1/3 of your data. Please read the [High Availability Cluster Configuration](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/cluster-and-ha-management/ha-cluster) documentation for additional details about partitions and replications. For the partition factor for each workspace size, please refer to the [Workspace Size](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/workgroup-workspace/workspaces/workspace-size) documentation.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#q-what-is-the-difference-between-replication-and-partition)**Q: How long do I need to wait for the cluster to be ready after provisioning process starts?**
A: It currently takes about 4 minutes to provision a workspace. It might take longer for Read-Only workspaces or Read-Write workspaces with a solution kit selected.

A: Yes, TigerGraph Savanna encrypts all data in transit and at rest.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_am_i_sharing_data_storage_with_other_customers_is_tigergraph_a_multi_tenant_cluster)**Q: Am I sharing data storage with other customers? Is TigerGraph a multi-tenant cluster?**
A: You are not sharing storage with other customers. For compute resources:
  * TG-2 and below: You share the virtual machine with other customers, but the TigerGraph database runs as containers, which are completely isolated from each other. Your data storage remains secure and isolated.
  * TG-4 and above: Each TigerGraph workspace is provisioned as one or more dedicated virtual machine instances of the TigerGraph engine, used exclusively for your account. These instances come with their own dedicated disk space, ensuring that no two accounts share the same TigerGraph database.


Additionally, the network is completely isolated per workgroup, providing an extra layer of security and ensuring that your network traffic is segregated from that of other customers.
This approach guarantees that your data and network remain private and secure, regardless of the compute resource tier you are using.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_how_do_i_access_my_tigergraph_savanna_account_e_g_username_and_password)**Q: How do I access my TigerGraph Savanna account (e.g., username and password)?**
A: When you register your account, you can select either a username and password or Google SSO for authentication. You can then log in anytime at [tgcloud.io](http://tgcloud.io/). We also support Okta and AAD integration. If you are a paid tier customer, please submit a support ticket to request advanced service to integrate into an SSO system TigerGraph supports.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_how_do_i_access_my_tigergraph_database_and_post_to_tigergraph)**Q: How do I access my TigerGraph database and POST to TigerGraph?**
A: You can access the database through the TigerGraph Savanna portal, TigerGraph GraphStudio™ visual interface and through RESTful endpoints. Use RESTful endpoints to POST to TigerGraph clusters and develop applications. Please refer to the [RESTful API User Guide](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/) for more information. To find the RESTful endpoints for queries created in GraphStudio™, please read our documentation on [showing query endpoints](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/graphstudio/write-queries). There is also a recorded webinar which demos the process in detail: [Graph Gurus Episode 24](https://info.tigergraph.com/graph-gurus-24)
**Here is the step-by-step instructions:**
TigerGraph Savanna enables [REST++ Authentication](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/API/authentication) to securely connect TigerGraph Savanna workspaces with your application through an endpoint on port 443 at `443/restpp/<endpoint>`.
**Step 1:** (First time only) Navigate to the TigerGraph cluster’s Admin Portal, and generate a secret from User Management.
For example, the URL for the cluster is:
```
https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:443/admin/#/user-management
text![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

and the generated secret is `abcd1234` from the Admin Portal.
**Step 2:** (Need to renew every lifetime) Use the secret generated in step 1 to get a RESTPP token (for example, xyz789) using `curl`. Access RESTPP endpoints on port 443 using the syntax `443/restpp/<endpoint>`.
Here is an example where you obtain a token with a lifetime of 1,000,000 seconds (11 days):
```
curl -X POST 'https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:443/restpp/requesttoken -d '{"secret"="abcd1234", "lifetime"="1000000"}'
text![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

```
{
 "code":"REST-0000",
 "expiration":1570727825,
 "error":false,
 "message":"Generate new token successfully.",
 "token":"xyz789"
}
text![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**Step 3:** Now in your application, use the token in the REST call as follows:
```
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer xyz789" 'https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:443/restpp/graph/MyGraph/vertices/Account?limit=3'
text![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/savanna/main/resources/faqs#_q_how_can_i_improve_the_speed_of_my_system)**Q: How can I improve the speed of my system?**
A: Due to TigerGraph’s massively parallel and hybrid in-memory database design, an instance with more vCPUs and more memory will usually run faster. For a given hardware configuration, performance can be improved by optimizing graph schema, loading jobs, and queries. In TigerGraph Distributed Cloud, you can also choose to provision a cluster with replication factor 2 to increase throughput. Contact sales@tigergraph.com to discuss query optimization services.
