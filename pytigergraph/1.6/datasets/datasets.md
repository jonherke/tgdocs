# Data Ingestion Functions
### Contents
  * [ingestDataset()](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/datasets/datasets#_ingestdataset)


Ingest stock datasets into a TigerGraph database. All functions in this module are called as methods on a [`TigerGraphConnection` object](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/core-functions/base).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/datasets/datasets#_ingestdataset)ingestDataset()
`ingestDataset(dataset: Datasets, cleanup: bool = True, getToken: bool = False) → None`
Ingest a stock dataset to a TigerGraph database.
#### Parameters:
  * `dataset (Datasets)`: A Datasets object as `pyTigerGraph.datasets.Datasets`.
  * `cleanup (bool, optional)`: Whether or not to remove local artifacts downloaded by `Datasets` after ingestion is done. Defaults to True.
  * `getToken (bool, optional)`: Whether or not to get auth token from the database. This is required when auth token is enabled for the database. Defaults to False.
