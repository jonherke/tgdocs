The Object-Oriented Schema functionality allows users to manipulate schema elements in the database in an object-oriented approach in Python.
To add an AccountHolder vertex and a HOLDS_ACCOUNT edge to the Ethereum dataset, simply:
```
from pyTigerGraph import TigerGraphConnection
from pyTigerGraph.schema import Graph, Vertex, Edge
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Union
from dataclasses import dataclass, fields
conn = TigerGraphConnection(host="http://YOUR_HOSTNAME_HERE", graphname="Ethereum")
g = Graph(conn)

@dataclass
class AccountHolder(Vertex):
  name: str
  address: str
  accounts: List[str]
  dob: datetime
  some_map: Dict[str, int]
  some_double: "DOUBLE"
  primary_id: str = "name" # always of type string, corresponds to the desired primary ID attribute.
  primary_id_as_attribute: bool = True
@dataclass
class HOLDS_ACCOUNT(Edge):
  opened_on: datetime
  from_vertex: Union[AccountHolder, g.vertex_types["Account"]]
  to_vertex: g.vertex_types["Account"]
  is_directed: bool = True
  reverse_edge: str = "ACCOUNT_HELD_BY"
  discriminator: str = "opened_on"
g.add_vertex_type(AccountHolder)
g.add_edge_type(HOLDS_ACCOUNT)
g.commit_changes()
py![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

Users can define an entire graph schema in the approach below. Using the Cora dataset example, the schema would look something like this:
```
from pyTigerGraph import TigerGraphConnection
from pyTigerGraph.schema import Graph, Vertex, Edge
conn = TigerGraphConnection("http://YOUR_HOSTNAME_HERE")
g = Graph()
@dataclass
class Paper(Vertex):
  id: int
  y: int
  x: List[int]
  primary_id: str = "id"
  primary_id_as_attribute: bool = True
@dataclass
class CITES(Edge):
  from_vertex: Paper
  to_vertex: Paper
  is_directed: bool = True
  reverse_edge: str = "R_CITES"
g.add_vertex_type(Paper)
g.add_edge_type(CITES)
g.commit_changes(conn)
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_vertex)Vertex
Abstract parent class for other types of vertices to be inherited from. Contains class methods to edit the attributes associated with the vertex type.
When defining new vertex types, make sure to include the `primary_id` and `primary_id_as_attribute` class attributes, as these are necessary to define the vertex in TigerGraph.
For example, to define an AccountHolder vertex type, use:
```
@dataclass
class AccountHolder(Vertex):
  name: str
  address: str
  accounts: List[str]
  dob: datetime
  some_map: Dict[str, int]
  some_double: "DOUBLE"
  primary_id: str = "name"
  primary_id_as_attribute: bool = True

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_add_attribute)add_attribute()
`add_attribute(attribute_name: str, attribute_type, default_value = None)`
Function to add an attribute to the given vertex type.
#### Parameters:
  * `attribute_name (str)`: The name of the attribute to add
  * `attribute_type (Python type)`: The Python type of the attribute to add. For types that are not supported in Python but are in GSQL, wrap them in quotes; e.g. "DOUBLE"
  * `default_value (type of attribute, default None)`: The desired default value of the attribute. Defaults to None.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_remove_attribute)remove_attribute()
`remove_attribute(attribute_name)`
Function to remove an attribute from the given vertex type.
#### Parameter:
  * `attribute_name (str)`: The name of the attribute to remove from the vertex.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_attributes)attributes()
`attributes()`
Class attribute to view the attributes and types of the vertex.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_edge)Edge
Abstract parent class for other types of edges to be inherited from. Contains class methods to edit the attributes associated with the edge type.
When defining new vertex types, make sure to include the required `from_vertex`, `to_vertex`, `reverse_edge`, `is_directed` attributes and optionally the `discriminator` attribute, as these are necessary to define the vertex in TigerGraph.
For example, to define an HOLDS_ACCOUNT edge type, use:
```
@dataclass
class HOLDS_ACCOUNT(Edge):
  opened_on: datetime
  from_vertex: Union[AccountHolder, g.vertex_types["Account"]]
  to_vertex: g.vertex_types["Account"]
  is_directed: bool = True
  reverse_edge: str = "ACCOUNT_HELD_BY"
  discriminator: str = "opened_on"

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_add_attribute_2)add_attribute()
`add_attribute(attribute_name, attribute_type, default_value = None)`
Function to add an attribute to the given edge type.
#### Parameters:
  * `attribute_name (str)`: The name of the attribute to add.
  * `attribute_type (Python type)`: The Python type of the attribute to add. For types that are not supported in Python but are in GSQL, wrap them in quotes; e.g. "DOUBLE"
  * `default_value (type of attribute, default None)`: The desired default value of the attribute. Defaults to None.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/object_oriented_schema/schema-def#_remove_attribute_2)remove_attribute()
