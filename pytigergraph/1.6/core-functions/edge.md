Functions to upsert, retrieve and delete edges. All functions in this module are called as methods on a [`TigerGraphConnection` object](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/current/core-functions/base).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getedgetypes)getEdgeTypes()
`getEdgeTypes(force: bool = False) → list`
Returns the list of edge type names of the graph.
#### Parameter:
  * `force`: If `True`, forces the retrieval the schema metadata again, otherwise returns a cached copy of edge type metadata (if they were already fetched previously).


#### Returns:
The list of edge types defined in the current graph.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getedgetype)getEdgeType()
`getEdgeType(edgeType: str, force: bool = False) → dict`
Returns the details of the edge type.
#### Parameters:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.
  * `force`: If `True`, forces the retrieval the schema details again, otherwise returns a cached copy of edge type details (if they were already fetched previously).


#### Returns:
The metadata of the edge type.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getedgeattrs)getEdgeAttrs()
`getEdgeAttrs(edgeType: str) → list`
Returns the names and types of the attributes of the edge type.
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
A list of (attribute_name, attribute_type) tuples. The format of attribute_type is one of - "scalar_type" - "complex_type(scalar_type)" - "map_type(key_type,value_type)" and it is a string.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getedgesourcevertextype)getEdgeSourceVertexType()
`getEdgeSourceVertexType(edgeType: str) → Union[str, set]`
Returns the type(s) of the edge type’s source vertex.
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
  * A single source vertex type name string if the edge has a single source vertex type.
  * "*" if the edge can originate from any vertex type (notation used in 2.6.1 and earlier versions). See [this](https://docs.tigergraph.com/v/2.6/dev/gsql-ref/ddl-and-loading/defining-a-graph-schema#creating-an-edge-from-or-to-any-vertex-type) for more details.
  * A set of vertex type name strings (unique values) if the edge has multiple source vertex types (notation used in 3.0 and later versions). Even if the source vertex types were defined as `"*"`, the REST API will list them as pairs (i.e. not as `"*"` in 2.6.1 and earlier versions), just like as if there were defined one by one (e.g. `FROM v1, TO v2 | FROM v3, TO v4 | …`).


The returned set contains all source vertex types, but it does not certainly mean that the edge is defined between all source and all target vertex types. You need to look at the individual source/target pairs to find out which combinations are valid/defined.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getedgetargetvertextype)getEdgeTargetVertexType()
`getEdgeTargetVertexType(edgeType: str) → Union[str, set]`
Returns the type(s) of the edge type’s target vertex.
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
  * A single target vertex type name string if the edge has a single target vertex type.
  * "*" if the edge can end in any vertex type (notation used in 2.6.1 and earlier versions). See [this](https://docs.tigergraph.com/v/2.6/dev/gsql-ref/ddl-and-loading/defining-a-graph-schema#creating-an-edge-from-or-to-any-vertex-type) for more details.
  * A set of vertex type name strings (unique values) if the edge has multiple target vertex types (notation used in 3.0 and later versions). Even if the target vertex types were defined as "*", the REST API will list them as pairs (i.e. not as "*" in 2.6.1 and earlier versions), just like as if there were defined one by one (e.g. `FROM v1, TO v2 | FROM v3, TO v4 | …`).


The returned set contains all target vertex types, but does not certainly mean that the edge is defined between all source and all target vertex types. You need to look at the individual source/target pairs to find out which combinations are valid/defined.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_isdirected)isDirected()
`isDirected(edgeType: str) → bool`
Is the specified edge type directed?
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
`True`, if the edge is directed.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getreverseedge)getReverseEdge()
`getReverseEdge(edgeType: str) → str`
Returns the name of the reverse edge of the specified edge type, if applicable.
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
The name of the reverse edge, if it was defined.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_ismultiedge)isMultiEdge()
`isMultiEdge(edgeType: str) → bool`
Can the edge have multiple instances between the same pair of vertices?
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
`True`, if the edge can have multiple instances between the same pair of vertices.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getdiscriminators)getDiscriminators()
`getDiscriminators(edgeType: str) → list`
Returns the names and types of the discriminators of the edge type.
#### Parameter:
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.


#### Returns:
A list of (attribute_name, attribute_type) tuples.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_getedgecountfrom)getEdgeCountFrom()
`getEdgeCountFrom(sourceVertexType: str = "", sourceVertexId: Union[str, int] = None, edgeType: str = "", targetVertexType: str = "", targetVertexId: Union[str, int] = None, where: str = "") → dict`
Returns the number of edges from a specific vertex.
#### Parameters:
  * `sourceVertexType`: The name of the source vertex type.
  * `sourceVertexId`: The primary ID value of the source vertex instance.
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.
  * `targetVertexType`: The name of the target vertex type.
  * `targetVertexId`: The primary ID value of the target vertex instance.
  * `where`: A comma separated list of conditions that are all applied on each edge’s attributes. The conditions are in logical conjunction (i.e. they are "AND’ed" together).


#### Returns:
A dictionary of `edge_type: edge_count` pairs.
#### Uses:
  * If `edgeType` = "*": edge count of all edge types (no other arguments can be specified in this case).
  * If `edgeType` is specified only: edge count of the given edge type.
  * If `sourceVertexType`, `edgeType`, `targetVertexType` are specified: edge count of the given edge type between source and target vertex types.
  * If `sourceVertexType`, `sourceVertexId` are specified: edge count of all edge types from the given vertex instance.
  * If `sourceVertexType`, `sourceVertexId`, `edgeType` are specified: edge count of all edge types from the given vertex instance.
  * If `sourceVertexType`, `sourceVertexId`, `edgeType`, `where` are specified: the edge count of the given edge type after filtered by `where` condition.
  * If `targetVertexId` is specified, then `targetVertexType` must also be specified.
  * If `targetVertexType` is specified, then `edgeType` must also be specified.


#### Endpoints:
  * `GET /graph/{graph_name}/edges/{source_vertex_type}/{source_vertex_id}` See [this](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/api/built-in-endpoints#_list_edges_of_a_vertex) for more details.

Upserts an edge.
Data is upserted:
  * If edge is not yet present in graph, it will be created (see special case below).
  * If it’s already in the graph, it is updated with the values specified in the request.
  * If `vertex_must_exist` is True then edge will only be created if both vertex exists in graph. Otherwise missing vertices are created with the new edge; the newly created vertices' attributes (if any) will be created with default values.


#### Parameters:
  * `sourceVertexType`: The name of the source vertex type.
  * `sourceVertexId`: The primary ID value of the source vertex instance.
  * `edgeType`: The name of the edge type.
  * `targetVertexType`: The name of the target vertex type.
  * `targetVertexId`: The primary ID value of the target vertex instance.
  * `attributes`: A dictionary in this format:
```
{<attribute_name>, <attribute_value>|(<attribute_name>, <operator>), …}

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/core-functions/edge#_edgesettodataframe)edgeSetToDataFrame()
`edgeSetToDataFrame(edgeSet: list, withId: bool = True, withType: bool = False) → pd.DataFrame`
Converts an edge set to Pandas DataFrame
Edge sets contain instances of the same edge type. Edge sets are not generated "naturally" like vertex sets. Instead, you need to collect edges in (global) accumulators, like when you want to visualize them in GraphStudio or by other tools.
For example:
```
SetAccum<EDGE> @@edges;
start = {country.*};
result =
  SELECT trg
  FROM  start:src -(city_in_country:e)- city:trg
  ACCUM @@edges += e;
PRINT start, result, @@edges;
![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

The `@@edges` is an edge set. It contains, for each edge instance, the source and target vertex type and ID, the edge type, a directedness indicator and the (optional) attributes.
`start` and `result` are vertex sets.   
---  
An edge set has this structure (when serialised as JSON):
```
[
{
"e_type": <edge_type_name>,
"from_type": <source_vertex_type_name>,
"from_id": <source_vertex_id>,
"to_type": <target_vertex_type_name>,
"to_id": <targe_vertex_id>,
"directed": <true_or_false>,
"attributes":
{
"attr1": <value1>,
"attr2": <value2>,
⋮
}
},
⋮
]
json![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

#### Parameters:
  * `edgeSet`: A JSON array containing an edge set in the format returned by queries (see below).
  * `withId`: Whether to include the type and primary ID of source and target vertices as a column. Default is `True`.
  * `withType`: Whether to include edge type info as a column. Default is `False`.


#### Returns:
A pandas DataFrame containing the edge attributes and optionally the type and primary ID or source and target vertices, and the edge type.
