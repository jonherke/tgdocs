`_init_(num_layers: int, out_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, dropout = 0.0, heterogeneous = None, class_weights = None)`
Initialize the GraphSAGE Vertex Classification Model.
#### Parameters:
  * `num_layers (int)`: The number of layers in the model. Typically corresponds to `num_hops` in the dataloader.
  * `out_dim (int)`: The number of output dimensions. Corresponds to the number of classes in the classification task.
  * `hidden_dim (int)`: The hidden dimension to use.
  * `dropout (float, optional)`: The amount of dropout to apply between the layers. Defaults to 0.
  * `heterogeneous (tuple, optional)`: If set, use the graph metadata in the PyG heterogeneous metadata format. Can also retrieve this from the dataloader by calling `loader.metadata()`. Defaults to None.
  * `class_weights (torch.Tensor, optional)`: If set, weight the different classes in the loss function. Used in imbalanced classification tasks.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_forward)forward()

Make a forward pass.
#### Parameters:
  * `batch (torch_geometric.Data or torch_geometric.HeteroData)`: The PyTorch Geometric data object to classify.
  * `get_probs (bool, optional)`: Return the softmax scores of the raw logits, which can be interpreted as probabilities. Defaults to false.
  * `target_type (str, optional)`: Name of the vertex type to get the logits of. Defaults to None, and will return logits for all vertex types.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_compute_loss)compute_loss()
`compute_loss(logits, batch, target_type = None, loss_fn = None)`
Compute loss.
#### Parameters:
  * `logits (torch.Tensor or dict of torch.Tensor)`: The output of the forward pass.
  * `batch (torch_geometric.Data or torch_geometric.HeteroData)`: The PyTorch Geometric data object to classify. Assumes the target is represented in the `"y"` data object.
  * `target_type (str, optional)`: The string of the vertex type to compute the loss on.
  * `loss_fn (callable, optional)`: The function to compute the loss with. Uses cross entropy loss if not defined.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_graphsageforvertexregression)GraphSAGEForVertexRegression
Use GraphSAGE for vertex regression tasks. By default, this model collects `RegressionMetrics`, and uses MSE as its loss function.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_init_2)__init__()
`_init_(num_layers: int, out_dim: int, hidden_dim: int, dropout = 0.0, heterogeneous = None)`
Initialize the GraphSAGE Vertex Regression Model.
#### Parameters:
  * `num_layers (int)`: The number of layers in the model. Typically corresponds to `num_hops` in the dataloader.
  * `out_dim (int)`: The dimension of the output. Corresponds to the size of vector to perform the regression of.
  * `hidden_dim (int)`: The hidden dimension to use.
  * `dropout (float, optional)`: The amount of dropout to apply between layers. Defaults to 0.0.
  * `heterogeneous (tuple, optional)`: If set, use the graph metadata in the PyG heterogeneous metadata format. Can also retrieve this from the dataloader by calling `loader.metadata()`. Defaults to None.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_forward_2)forward()
`forward(batch, target_type = None)`
Make a forward pass.
#### Parameters:
  * `batch (torch_geometric.Data or torch_geometric.HeteroData)`: The PyTorch Geometric data object to classify.
  * `target_type (str, optional)`: Name of the vertex type to get the logits of. Defaults to None, and will return logits for all vertex types.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_compute_loss_2)compute_loss()
`compute_loss(logits, batch, target_type = None, loss_fn = None)`
Compute loss.
#### Parameters:
  * `logits (torch.Tensor or dict of torch.Tensor)`: The output of the forward pass.
  * `batch (torch_geometric.Data or torch_geometric.HeteroData)`: The PyTorch Geometric data object to classify. Assumes the target is represented in the `"y"` data object.
  * `target_type (str, optional)`: The string of the vertex type to compute the loss on.
  * `loss_fn (callable, optional)`: The function to compute the loss with. Uses MSE loss if not defined.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_graphsageforlinkprediction)GraphSAGEForLinkPrediction
By default, this model collects `LinkPredictionMetrics` with k = 10, and uses binary cross entropy as its loss function.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.6/gds/graphsage#_init_3)__init__()
`_init_(num_layers, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, dropout = 0.0, heterogeneous = None)`
