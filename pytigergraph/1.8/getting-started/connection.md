Having installed pyTigerGraph, the next step is to connect to a running TigerGraph instance to access and make changes to your graph data.
TigerGraph Cloud instances and non-Cloud instances require different credentials. This page covers both connections to Cloud and non-Cloud instances.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_prerequisites)1. Prerequisites
  * pyTigerGraph is installed on your machine.
  * You have access to a running TigerGraph instance.
  * You have created a graph on your TigerGraph instance.
  * If your TigerGraph instance has authentication enabled, you have created a graph, and generated a [secret](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/user-credentials#_secrets). See [Managing Credentials](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/user-credentials#_create_a_secret) for how to create a secret.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_connect_to_a_graph_on_a_non_cloud_tigergraph_instance)2. Connect to a graph on a non-Cloud TigerGraph instance
To access a graph on a non-Cloud TigerGraph instance, you need to provide the following information:
  * Hostname or IP address of the instance
  * Name of the graph you are connecting to
  * Your [database username and password](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/#_users_and_credentials)
  * Secret associated with your database user and graph


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_initiate_connection)2.1. Initiate connection
Use the `TigerGraphConnection` function to initiate a connection to your TigerGraph instance:
```
conn = tg.TigerGraphConnection(host="<hostname>", graphname="<graph_name>", username="<username>", password="<password>") **(1)**
conn.getToken(<secret>) **(2)**
python![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | The username and password are provided via the constructor of [the `TigerGraphConnection` class](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/base).  
---|---  
**2** | Secrets are unique strings that serve as a user’s credentials when generating authentication tokens for REST API endpoints.  
The graph in this context is a logical container that consists of object type definitions (vertex and edge types, user-defined types (UDTs), data sources, etc.) and the instances of these object types. A TigerGraph instance can contain multiple graphs, so you need to specify which one you want to use.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_generate_authentication_token)2.2. Generate authentication token
If the instance has user authentication enabled, you also need to provide a [secret](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/user-credentials#_secrets), which is a unique string that serve as a user’s credential when creating authentication tokens for TigerGraph’s REST API endpoints.
Run the following function to generate an authentication. After running the function, the token is saved to the `TigerGraphConnection` object, and you can now use its methods to access and modify graph data.
```
conn.getToken(<secret>)
python![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_example)2.3. Example
In this command, the user is connecting to the `127.0.0.1` host and accessing the `GoodsDelivery` graph, providing the username `hsolo` and corresponding password `f4lc0n` as well as the secret for the bearer token authentication scheme.
```
from pyTigerGraph import TigerGraphConnection
conn = TigerGraphConnection(host="127.0.0.1", graphname="GoodsDelivery", username="hsolo", password="f4lc0n")
conn.getToken('oodvd1upqbj96vq22jof21o8nl8cjkd5') **(1)**
python![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | The string in the `getToken()` argument is a secret. See [tigergraph-server:user-access:managing-credentials.adoc#_create_a_secret](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/user-credentials#_create_a_secret) for how to create a secret.  
---|---  
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_connect_to_a_graph_on_a_tigergraph_cloud_instance)3. Connect to a graph on a TigerGraph Cloud instance
This process applies to TigerGraph Cloud solutions created after July 5th, 2022. If your solution was created before that date, follow [the procedure for non-Cloud instances](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_connect_to_a_graph_on_a_non_cloud_tigergraph_instance) instead to connect to your solution.   
---  
To connect to a TigerGraph Cloud instance, you no longer need to provide a username-password pair. You only need to provide the following information:
  * Hostname or IP address of the instance
  * Name of the graph you are connecting to
  * Secret associated with your database user and graph. To create a secret on TigerGraph Cloud, you need to use Admin Portal interface and click the plus sign on the[ My Profile page to create a secret for your user](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gui/4.2/admin-portal/management/user-management#_my_profile).


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_establish_initial_connection)3.1. Establish initial connection
Use the `TigerGraphConnection` constructor function to declare a `TigerGraphConnection` object:
```
from pyTigerGraph import TigerGraphConnection
conn = TigerGraphConnection(
  host=<hostname>,
  graphname=<graph_name>,
  gsqlSecret=<secret>,
)
python![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_generate_authentication_token_2)3.2. Generate authentication token
Cloud instances all have authentication enabled. Before you can access graph data, you need to run `getToken()` function to generate a authentication token. You need to provide your secret again in this function call:
```
conn.getToken(<secret>)
python![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/getting-started/connection#_example_2)3.3. Example
In this command, the user is connecting to the `r_alliance.i.tgcloud.io` cloud instance and accessing the `GoodsDelivery` graph, providing the secret for the bearer token authentication scheme.
```
from pyTigerGraph import TigerGraphConnection
conn = TigerGraphConnection(host="r_alliance.i.tgcloud.io", graphname="GoodsDelivery", gsqlSecret="oodvd1upqbj96vq22jof21o8nl8cjkd5") **(1)**
conn.getToken('oodvd1upqbj96vq22jof21o8nl8cjkd5') **(1)**
python![copy icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/_/img/octicons-16.svg#view-clippy)Copied!

```

**1** | The string in the `getToken()` argument is a secret. See [Managing Credentials](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/4.2/user-access/user-credentials#_create_a_secret) for how to create a secret.
