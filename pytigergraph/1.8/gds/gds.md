Factory Functions are a special collection of functions that return an instance of a class.
All factory functions are methods of the `GDS` class. You can call a factory function after instantiating a TigerGraph Connection. For example:
```
conn = TigerGraphConnection(
  host="http://127.0.0.1",
  graphname="Cora",
  username="tigergraph",
  password="tigergraph",
)
edge_loader = conn.gds.edgeLoader(
  num_batches=1,
  attributes=["time", "is_train"])

```

The object returned has access to instance methods of the class. You can find the reference for those classes on the following pages:

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/gds#_neighborloader)neighborLoader()
`neighborLoader(v_in_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, v_out_labels: Union[list, dict] = None, v_extra_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, v_seed_types: Union[str, list] = None, e_in_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, e_out_labels: Union[list, dict] = None, e_extra_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, batch_size: int = None, num_batches: int = 1, num_neighbors: int = 10, num_hops: int = 2, shuffle: bool = False, filter_by: str = None, output_format: str = "PyG", add_self_loop: bool = False, loader_id: str = None, buffer_size: int = 4, reverse_edge: bool = False, delimiter: str = "|", timeout: int = 300000, callback_fn: Callable = None, reinstall_query: bool = False, distributed_query: bool = False) → NeighborLoader`
Returns a `NeighborLoader` instance. A `NeighborLoader` instance performs neighbor sampling from vertices in the graph in batches in the following manner:
  1. It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of vertices as seeds. The number of batches is the total number of vertices divided by the batch size.
     * If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches. If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority.
  2. It picks a specified number (`num_neighbors`) of neighbors of each seed at random.
  3. It picks the same number of neighbors for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).


This generates one subgraph. As you loop through this data loader, every vertex will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph expanded from the seeds. If you want to limit seeds to certain vertices, the boolean attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which vertices can be included as seeds. If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`, `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the vertex or edge types.
When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time, the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding query to the database. However, the query installation only needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader on the same graph again.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/gds#_edgeloader)edgeLoader()
`edgeLoader(attributes: Union[list, dict] = None, batch_size: int = None, num_batches: int = 1, shuffle: bool = False, filter_by: str = None, output_format: str = "dataframe", loader_id: str = None, buffer_size: int = 4, reverse_edge: bool = False, delimiter: str = "|", timeout: int = 300000, callback_fn: Callable = None, reinstall_query: bool = False, distributed_query: bool = False) → EdgeLoader`
Returns an `EdgeLoader` instance. An `EdgeLoader` instance loads all edges in the graph in batches.
It divides all edges into `num_batches` and returns each batch separately. You can also specify the size of each batch, and the number of batches is calculated accordingly. If you provide both parameters, `batch_size` take priority. The boolean attribute provided to `filter_by` indicates which edges are included. If you want to load from certain types of edges, use the `dict` input for `attributes` where keys of the dict are edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the edge types. If you need random batches, set `shuffle` to True.
When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time, the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding query to the database. However, the query installation only needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader on the same graph again.   
---  
There are two ways to use the data loader.
  * It can be used as an iterable, which means you can loop through it to get every batch of data. If you load all edges at once (`num_batches=1`), there will be only one batch (of all the edges) in the iterator.
  * You can access the `data` property of the class directly. If there is only one batch of data to load, it will give you the batch directly instead of an iterator. If there are multiple batches of data to load, it returns the loader itself.


#### Parameters:
  * `attributes (list or dict, optional)`: Edge attributes to be included. If it is a list, then the attributes in the list from all edge types will be selected. An error will be thrown if certain attribute doesn’t exist in all edge types. If it is a dict, keys of the dict are edge types to be selected, and values are lists of attributes to be selected for each edge type. Numeric, boolean and string attributes are allowed. Defaults to None.
  * `batch_size (int, optional)`: Number of edges in each batch. Defaults to None.
  * `num_batches (int, optional)`: Number of batches to split the edges. Defaults to 1.
  * `shuffle (bool, optional)`: Whether to shuffle the edges before loading data. Defaults to False.

Defaults to None.
  * `output_format (str, optional)`: Format of the output data of the loader. Only "dataframe" is supported. Defaults to "dataframe".
  * `loader_id (str, optional)`: An identifier of the loader which can be any string. It is also used as the Kafka topic name if Kafka topic is not given. If `None`, a random string will be generated for it. Defaults to None.

  * `timeout (int, optional)`: Timeout value for GSQL queries, in ms. Defaults to 300000.
  * `callback_fn (callable, optional)`: A callable function to apply to each batch in the dataloader. Defaults to None.

Returns a `GraphLoader`instance. A `GraphLoader` instance loads all edges from the graph in batches, along with the vertices that are connected with each edge.
Different from NeighborLoader which produces connected subgraphs, this loader generates (random) batches of edges and vertices attached to those edges.
If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`, `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the vertex or edge types.

Returns an `EdgeNeighborLoader` instance. An `EdgeNeighborLoader` instance performs neighbor sampling from all edges in the graph in batches in the following manner:
  1. It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of edges as seeds. The number of batches is the total number of edges divided by the batch size.
     * If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches. If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority.
  2. Starting from the vertices attached to the seed edges, it picks a specified number (`num_neighbors`) of neighbors of each vertex at random.
  3. It picks the same number of neighbors for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).


This generates one subgraph. As you loop through this data loader, every edge will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph expanded from the seeds. If you want to limit seeds to certain edges, the boolean attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which edges can be included as seeds. If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`, `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the vertex or edge types.
When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time, the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding query to the database. However, the query installation only needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader on the same graph again.

Returns a `NodePieceLoader` instance. A `NodePieceLoader` instance loads all edges from the graph in batches, along with the vertices that are connected with each edge.
The NodePiece algorithm borrows the idea of "tokenization" from Natural Language Processing. The dataloader offers the functionality to "tokenize" the graph in the form of randomly selecting "anchor vertices". If you are running NodePiece for the first time, anchors have to be created.
The first time you initialize the loader on a graph, it must first install the corresponding query to the database. However, the query installation only needs to be done once, so you will not need to wait when you initialize the loader on the same graph again.   
---  
There are two ways to use the data loader:
  * It can be used as an iterable, which means you can loop through it to get every batch of data. If you load all data at once (`num_batches=1`), there will be only one batch (of all the data) in the iterator.
  * You can access the `data` property of the class directly. If there is only one batch of data to load, it will give you the batch directly instead of an iterator, which might make more sense in that case. If there are multiple batches of data to load, it will return the loader itself.


#### Parameters:
  * `v_feats (list or dict, optional)`: If a heterogenous graph, dictionary of the form {"VERTEX_TYPE": ["vertex_attribute1", …​]}. If a homogeneous graph, list of the form ["vertex_attribute1", …​]. If None, all vertex types will be used, but no vertex attributes will be loaded. If not None, only vertex types specified will be used.
  * `target_vertex_types (str or list, optional)`: A list or string of vertex types that are going to be used for training the model. If None, the vertex types specified in v_feats will be used.
  * `compute_anchors (bool, optional)`: False by default. If set to True, the dataloader will compute anchors and store them in the attribute defined by `anchor_attribute`.
  * `use_cache (bool, optional)`: False by default. If True, will cache the result of the anchor search process onto the attribute defined by `anchor_cache_attr`. Must define `anchor_cache_attr` if True.
  * `clear_cache (bool, optional)`: False by default. If True, the cache of the anchor search process will be cleared for the attribute defined by `anchor_cache_attr`.
  * `anchor_method (str, optional)`: "random" by default. Currently, "random" anchor selection strategy is the only strategy supported.
  * `anchor_cache_attr (str, optional)`: Defines the attribute name to store the cached anchor search results in. By default, the attribute is "anchors".
  * `max_distance (int, optional)`: The max number of hops away in the graph to search for anchors. Defaults to 5.
  * `max_anchors (int, optional)`: The max number of anchors used to generate representation of target vertex. Defaults to 10.

## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/gds#_hgtloader)hgtLoader()
`hgtLoader(num_neighbors: dict, v_in_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, v_out_labels: Union[list, dict] = None, v_extra_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, v_seed_types: Union[str, list] = None, e_in_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, e_out_labels: Union[list, dict] = None, e_extra_feats: Union[list, dict] = None, batch_size: int = None, num_batches: int = 1, num_hops: int = 2, shuffle: bool = False, filter_by: str = None, output_format: str = "PyG", add_self_loop: bool = False, loader_id: str = None, buffer_size: int = 4, reverse_edge: bool = False, delimiter: str = "|", timeout: int = 300000, callback_fn: Callable = None, reinstall_query: bool = False, distributed_query: bool = False) → HGTLoader`
Returns a `HGTLoader` instance. A `HGTLoader` instance performs stratified neighbor sampling from vertices in the graph in batches in the following manner:
  1. It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of vertices as seeds. The number of batches is the total number of vertices divided by the batch size.
     * If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches. If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority.
  2. It picks a specified number of neighbors of each type (as specified by the dict `num_neighbors`) of each seed at random.
  3. It picks the specified number of neighbors of every type for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).


This generates one subgraph. As you loop through this data loader, every vertex will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph expanded from the seeds. If you want to limit seeds to certain vertices, the boolean attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which vertices can be included as seeds. If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`, `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the vertex or edge types.
When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time, the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding query to the database. However, the query installation only needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader on the same graph again.
