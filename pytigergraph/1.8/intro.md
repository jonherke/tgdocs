pyTigerGraph is a feature-rich package that allows you to interact with TigerGraph databases using Python. It enhances TigerGraph’s REST API by adding extra features, such as URL setup, log creation, authentication, and error checks. Therefore, pyTigerGraph may perform slower than direct HTTP requests to the TigerGraph REST API.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/intro/#_pytigergraph_vs_pytigergraphgds)pyTigerGraph vs. pyTigerGraph[gds]
We offer two versions of the package: _pyTigerGraph_ and _pyTigerGraph[gds]_.
_pyTigerGraph_ is the default version and contains the core functionality of pyTigerGraph, including the following:
  * Data manipulation functions:inserting, updating, upserting, deleting, and retrieving vertices and edges.
  * Query functions: running and managing [queries](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.2/querying/query-operations) inside the TigerGraph database
  * Metadata functions: fetching details of graphs/schemas, vertex and edge types, and other schema objects and object types
  * Authentication and authorization functions
  * Miscellaneous utility functions


The _pyTigerGraph[gds]_ version of pyTigerGraph is a drop-in replacement for _pyTigerGraph_ , but adds support for Graph Data Science and Graph machine learning capabilities. This includes:
  * Graph feature engineering using algorithms from the [GSQL Graph Data Science Library](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/intro/#graph-ml:intro:).
  * Data loaders for training and inference of Graph Neural Network (GNN) models using PyTorch Geometric and DGL.
  * Machine learning utilities for splitting vertices into training, validation, and testing sets.
