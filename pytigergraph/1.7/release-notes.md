Release of pyTigerGraph version 1.6.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_added_2)Added:
  * [TigerGraph CoPilot](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/ai/copilot). Added a new submodule for interacting with TigerGraph CoPilot, a framework for integrating Generative AI with TigerGraph.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_1_5_2023_09_25)[1.5] - 2023-09-25
Release of pyTigerGraph version 1.5.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_added_3)Added:
  * [Object-oriented schema definition and modifcation](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/object_oriented_schema/schema-def). Define graph schemas in native Python, without knowing GSQL.
  * `gsql()` handles some common error cases and raises an exception if they occur.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_changed)Changed:
  * Dataloaders that experience a parsing error due to missing/dirty data handle the error more gracefully.
  * Removed the use of pyTigerDriver for GSQL operations.
  * Various bug fixes.


## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_1_4_2023_05_16)[1.4] - 2023-05-16
Release of pyTigerGraph version 1.4.
**Note:** if you are using the Graph Data Science dataloaders, you must upgrade both the ML Workbench and pyTigerGraph to 1.4 at the same time. There is a incompatibility between v1.3 and v1.4 of pyTigerGraph and the corresponding ML Workbench versions.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_added_4)Added:
  * Additional Query Management Support
    * [`showQuery()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/query#_showquery) returns the GSQL of a given query.
    * [`getQueryMetadata()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/query#_getquerymetadata) returns the metadata details about a query, such as input parameters and what is returned in `PRINT` statements.
    * [`getRunningQueries()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/query#_getrunningqueries) shows the statistics of queries currently running on the graph.
    * [`abortQuery()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/query#_abortquery) aborts a selected query by ID or all queries on the graph.
  * Additional System Management Support
    * [`ping()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/utils#_ping) is a public API to check the health of the TigerGraph server.
    * [`getSystemMetrics()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/utils#_getsystemmetrics) monitors system metrics such as CPU and RAM usage.
    * [`getQueryPerformance()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/utils#_getqueryperformance) returns real-time query performance statistics over a given period.
    * [`getServiceStatus()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/utils#_getservicestatus) returns the status of TigerGraph services specified in the request.
    * [`rebuildGraph()`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/core-functions/utils#_rebuildgraph) [rebuilds](https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/3.9/API/built-in-endpoints#_rebuild_graph_engine) the graph immediately.
  * Built in Graph ML models and Trainer
    * [Various GraphSAGE models](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/graphsage) for vertex classification and regression, as well as link prediction.
    * [NodePiece MLP model](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/nodepiece) for vertex classification.
    * [General purpose trainer](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/trainer) to enable training of Graph ML models in a concise fashion.
  * Transforms
    * [`PyGTemporalTransform`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/pyg_transforms) to create a sequence of subgraphs for a given batch of data, in a temporal manner.
    * [`NodePieceMLPTransform`](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.8/gds/nodepiece_transforms) to transform a batch produced by a NodePiece dataloader into a batch that can be fed into a PyTorch multilayer perceptron.
  * Additional Dataloader Support
    * SSL Support: two-way SSL encryption via Kerberos.
    * Collaborative dataloaders: use dataloaders on multiple machines to pull batches from the same Kafka queue. Helpful for data distributed model training.
    * Datetime support in dataloaders: Output `DATETIME` attributes from the database using the dataloaders. Exports as UNIX epoch timestamps.
    * Optional `distributed_query` parameter in dataloaders if running on distributed database clusters. If set to True, installs the dataloader using the `DISTRIBUTED` keyword in the query heading. Useful for distributed database clusters.
    * `stop()` function in dataloaders: Kill the query producing batches for the dataloader immediately. Helpful for stopping the production of batches sent to Kafka after breaking out of a training loop.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/1.7/release-notes/#_changed_2)Changed:
  * Dataloader factory produces multiple dataloaders if `filter_by` is a list of different filters.
  * Improved the scalability of the NodePiece dataloader.
