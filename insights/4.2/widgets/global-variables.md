Global variables can be used for sharing data across multiple pages within the same application.
The `Global Variables` tab management window can be found in the general settings of the application to define shared data.

### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/global-variables#_variable_name)Variable Name
The name by which other widgets can refer to this variable. This is analogous to a variable name in a programming language.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/global-variables#_data_type)Data Type
A global variable has one of the following data types:
  * **Input** : Choose between various data types:
    * Number: any `FLOAT` or `INT` data type
    * String: any text string
    * Datetime: a string formatted as a date
    * Vertex: a vertex type and ID that can be passed into a GSQL query.
    * Bool: `True` or `False`
    * Map: a set of (key, value) pairs where the key type and value type are each one of {number, string, datetime, bool}.
    * List: an ordered sequence where the element type is one of {number, string, datetime, bool, vertex}.


### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/global-variables#_default_value)Default Value
The value of the global variable if not assigned by a user. Without a default value, the variable defined by the input is undefined.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/global-variables#_use_in_application)Use in Application
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/global-variables#_define_setter_for_global_variables)Define Setter for Global Variables
The value of the Global Variable can be changed through an input widget. Create a new input and bind it to the corresponding Global Variable.
![global variables input](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/global-variables-input.png)
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/global-variables#_binding)Binding
A Global Variable can be bound to the corresponding type of query parameter for all kinds widgets that can execute a query.
