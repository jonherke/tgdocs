# List and Map Support
As of version 4.2, the LIST and MAP query parameter types are supported in Insights.
  1. First create a GSQL query with list or map parameters in GraphStudio or a GSQL shell.


![list and map create](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/list-and-map-create.png)
  1. Then create a widget in Insights and select the query with list or map parameters.
    1. If you have static parameters, simply click on the relevant list or map parameter to input them, then execute and save.


![list and map custom](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/list-and-map-custom.png)
  1. If you have some dynamic parameters that need to be linked through input, please create or edit an input widget, add a corresponding type of list and map input, and then bind the corresponding input in the query parameters.
