The Table widget displays vertices in the format of a relational table, similar to a spreadsheet.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/table-widget#_table_settings)Table Settings
![table interface](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/table-interface.png)
Table widgets do not support visual customization in the same way as other widgets. However, they do support [Conditional Styling](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/conditional-styling).
Sort columns by clicking on the column title.
Edit columns with the edit button ![edit button](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/edit-button.png) in the settings menu on the right side of the page. The options that appear are the different types of data in your data set. Check the boxes to include them in the table view.
Delete columns with the trash icon ![trash icon](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/trash-icon.png) that appears to the right of the column name when hovering over it.
Rearrange columns with the six-dot icon ![six dot rearrange](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/_images/six-dot-rearrange.png) that appears to the left of the column name when hovering over it. Columns appear left to right corresponding with the order top to bottom in the column name section.
