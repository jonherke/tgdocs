If there are multiple `PRINT` statements, users can map multiple print values：
```
INTERPRET QUERY() FOR GRAPH MyGraph {
  PRINT "demo1";
  PRINT "demo2";
  PRINT "demo3";
}

Figure 5. Multiple `PRINT` Statement Example
If the multiple values are printed using `PRINT` and they include vertices or edges, only the value of the first attribute of the vertex or edge can be mapped.
```
INTERPRET QUERY() FOR GRAPH MyGraph {
  start = {City.*};
  start = SELECT c FROM City:c;
  PRINT start;
  PRINT "demo1";
}
