In TigerGraph Insights, widgets populate pages to provide easy-to-use graph visualizations for your data.
Widgets work similarly to query visualizers. After creating a widget, you create a query for it to display on your page and for users to interact with.
This page explains the types of widgets available to you with Insights and best practices for the use of each one.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_create_a_widget)Create a Widget
Each application page can have up to 20 widgets. Click on the **+** icon in the lower left corner of the page view to choose a new type of widget to add.
After creation, you can move and resize the widget appearance on your page.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_dynamic_widget_names)Dynamic widget names
Widget names can be fixed or dynamic. Dynamic names are updated through a variable created by an Inputs Widget. If you have an Inputs Widget, you can store the input value as a variable that can later be referenced in a query in another widget, or even in the name itself.
See the [Inputs Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/inputs) page for more.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_create_and_save_a_query)Create and save a query
As you create a widget, you will be prompted to enter a query for it to visualize. Different data types lend themselves to different visualization formats (see Types of Widgets for more information).
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_types_of_widgets)Types of widgets
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_graph_widget)[Graph Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/graph-widget)
Shows graph data as a connected network of vertices and edges that can be rearranged into any shape. Accepts data as vertices and edges.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_map_widget)[Map Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/map-widget)
Overlays graph data on a map. Accepts data as vertices and edges as long as each one has a numeric attribute to be interpreted as latitude and longitude.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_table_widget)[Table Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/table-widget)
Displays vertices as a relational table, similar to a spreadsheet. Supports any input data format.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_value_widget)[Value Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/single-value)
Displays the first attribute of the first vertex or edge in a query result. Ideal for displaying total counts or other summary values from a query.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_markdown_widget)[Markdown Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/markdown-widget)
Empowering users to incorporate formatted text, links, images, and diverse content to enrich the dashboard experience.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_line_chart_widget)[Line Chart Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/line-chart)
Displays a standard line chart. Accepts data as vertices and edges or a list of objects that contain at least one numeric attribute.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_bar_chart_widget)[Bar Chart Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/bar-chart)
Displays a standard bar chart. Accepts data as vertices and edges or a list of objects that contain at least one numeric attribute.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_pie_chart_widget)[Pie Chart Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/pie-chart)
Displays a standard pie chart. Accepts data as vertices and edges or a list of objects that contain at least one numeric attribute.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_sankey_chart_widget)[Sankey Chart Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/sankey)
Displays a Sankey chart, ideal for displaying flow from one set of values to another. Accepts data as vertices and edges.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_scatter_chart_widget)[Scatter Chart Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.2/widgets/scatter-plot-widget)
Provides a visual representation of the relationship between two numerical variables, allowing users to identify patterns or correlations in the data.
### [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_inputs_widget)[Inputs Widget](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/inputs)
An interactive widget that takes user input and stores it as a variable that can then be used in queries in other widgets. Supports any input data format.
## [](https://docs.tigergraph.com/insights/4.1/widgets/#_save_a_widget)Save a widget
To save a widget separately from an application or page, click the Save button.
